He's putting a large down payment on the car and my monthly payments are going to be so low! He would've bought the car but he wants my credit to get better. He is so amazing and he has been so helpful in so many ways! Feeling like the luckiest girl\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70",

Rules may vary depending on location and credit reporting service but what I was told was that the process of cosigning on the loan would not help her credit.  However, what  did work , although somewhat riskier, is that I funded an account in her name which was used to secure the loan.  As she pays the loan funds get released from the guarantee account  transferred to my account.  There was a very significant reduction in the interest rate on her car loan (since it was fully collateralized) and in a low interest market the loss of the use of funds was not material.",

Is not at all how interest rates work.\n\nLoan rates are 100% set by the lender, based on the US Daily Prime Rate. The rate *you* receive is based on several factors, including not just your \"general\" credit score (FICO, Credit Karma, VantageScores--all of those are different, and FICO has 10+ different scores depending on the product). The scores you want to know are the FICO AUTO 5, 4, and 2 products' scores from Experian, Eqifax, and TransUnion. So that's a potential of 9 different scores for just Auto alone.\n\nThe score determines the interest rate from the lender. But you also need to shop around lenders before you make an offer. Credit unions are usually your best bet. Dealer financing is the worst. I just paid off a 5 year $25k 1.99% interest loan that I got from my credit union in 2016; but when I was 22, I had a 23% rate on a $12K loan from, you guessed it, a dealership. \n\nLive and learn. Also know that your credit score WILL drop when you pay off that loan. Temporarily, anyway. Because the credit bureaus like you to have a mix of loan types and credit card debt. If you pay off a loan, it's worse (\"on paper\") tgan paying off credit card debt. But it's really better to not have debt at all, so screw the bureaus. You'll still improve your credit over time as long as you are still paying down your debt.",

            "body": ">Did he cosign the loan? If he did, that would help you with the interest rate.\n\nThat... Is not at all how interest rates work.\n\nLoan rates are 100% set by the lender, based on the US Daily Prime Rate. The rate *you* receive is based on several factors, including not just your \"general\" credit score (FICO, Credit Karma, VantageScores--all of those are different, and FICO has 10+ different scores depending on the product). The scores you want to know are the FICO AUTO 5, 4, and 2 products' scores from Experian, Eqifax, and TransUnion. So that's a potential of 9 different scores for just Auto alone.\n\nThe score determines the interest rate from the lender. But you also need to shop around lenders before you make an offer. Credit unions are usually your best bet. Dealer financing is the worst. I just paid off a 5 year $25k 1.99% interest loan that I got from my credit union in 2016; but when I was 22, I had a 23% rate on a $12K loan from, you guessed it, a dealership. \n\nLive and learn. Also know that your credit score WILL drop when you pay off that loan. Temporarily, anyway. Because the credit bureaus like you to have a mix of loan types and credit card debt. If you pay off a loan, it's worse (\"on paper\") tgan paying off credit card debt. But it's really better to not have debt at all, so screw the bureaus. You'll still improve your credit over time as long as you are still paying down your debt.",
