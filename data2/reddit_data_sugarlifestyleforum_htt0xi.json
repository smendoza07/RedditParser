    "body": "I've had 3 SDs now, all over the age of 55 and they all used such an aggressive amount of tongue. Like mouth wide open, leading with it immediately, so far in my mouth I gagged a couple times type of aggressive. No amount of body language, attempts at course correction, or closed lips has any impact. I'm not even sure explicitly saying they're using too much tongue would do anything. \n\nI've kissed a fair amount of people under 30 and I have never experienced this in my life prior to SA. On the rare occasions someone closer to my age (21F) used too much tongue off the bat, some subtle changes in my pacing was enough for them to get the hint. I've always thought of tongue as wasabi: a little bit adds some excitement, too much is overwhelming and ruins the dish. \n\nSo, the question is, is this a generational thing? Do older people tend to just use a lot of tongue? Is this just a coincidence and they all just happen to be bad kissers? Am I just being a prude? Please enlighten me, oh wise ones.",

It was random and had nothing to do with him or consent or tongue usage, it\u2019s just that after that he was a little less aggressive with the tongue. I had a lot to work on emotionally and I think he wanted to be gentler",
