Like if anything it helps my point cuz Sasuke lost most of his power (also the mass amount of chakra to use the rinnegan so much) and Naruto then doubled his Kurama power. It really does only make sense. Sasuke is still almost his speed and danger just obviously not as much chakra.\n\nThe only human on the planet stronger than Sasuke is Naruto, and that gap is massive itself between Sasuke and the rest of the world",

Boruto and Kawaki had to combine both their karma to open the portal once and then a second time to come back to Konoha. This is pretty fine compared to a \"real\" Otsutsuki like Kaguya still spamming portals. \n\nAlso Boruto is much much closer to og Naruto than Shippuden. There're a lot of ninja stuff, elemental jutsus are more used, more ninja tools, more plans, etc. Just look at the fights of the Boruto's team 7 and tell me it's not beautiful. Obviously they have to keep powerups because the continuation of the story wants it. One of the focal points of the Boruto series is about tools and how the user is good at using the tools. Hence why Momoshiki got obliterated, hence why ninja tools that reused jutsus were bad but the tools that are here as a bonus rather than compensating, are good. \n\nHopefully karma is the only powerup for Boruto (other than jougan but I think it's filler feature), and I'm confident that they will make him a skilled ninja who uses tactics, not just a chakra nuclear bomb that radiates pure power.",

Naruto and Sasuke are easily *stronger* than they were in Shippuden, however, they are *dumber*, though. Their battle sense is what took a hit, by virtue of them not getting main character plot treatment. They don't use their jutsu the same, they don't have as clever of plans, etc. Could be that they don't feel like taking the time and money necessary to give them fights that are equally as creative and cool as they were in Shippuden, or that its more of an intentional way to boost the new-gen characters. It wouldn't be compelling if Naruto and Sasuke just destroyed a villain anytime they show up. For the record, I hate that it is the way it is. I wish they would've done more of a 'Korra' thing and set it more in the future so they could protect their legacies and not fuck their power scaling. \n\nAlso, secondly, Isshiki is much stronger than Kaguya. Momoshiki is stronger than Kaguya, and we also can observe that Isshiki is much stronger than Momoshiki. Momoshiki has some weird scaling, but it seems like it can be attributed to bad writing. Kaguya definitely has had the most hax out of any Otsutsuki, but it doesn't make her the strongest. The guy who can (after 1 amp) kick Sasuke out of his PS and Naruto out of his Kurama avatar is. The guy who shit on Naruto and Sasuke is.\n\nWithout getting too much into it, you're stuck in Shippuden if you think Naruto and Sasuke wouldn't neg their younger counterparts.

End of Shippuden Sasuke and Naruto are objectively better out of the simple reason that both have their arms and Sasuke has all of the tailed beasts chakra, while Naruto has the truth seeking orbs. \n\nAlso Kishimoto literally said in an interview that Naruto got weaker, because he's out of shape.\nSad to see you become the very thing you accuse me off.\n\nLastly i want to add that i find Boruto's story line (or at least the anime adaptation, as i have yet to read it's manga counterpart) to be far inferior to any of Narutos arcs which is why idgaf about the fact that they lost bcs thwyr no longer the MCs.

KCM1 Naruto was able to create a bunch of clones with KCM, that were as strong as the third raikage each. That was KCM 1. SO6P Naruto could do many more which were all strong enough to damage Kaguya and wield the truth seeking orbs. Each one of them is able to while out an entire village in seconds. In the fight against Sasuke he used 2 ninja nukes to deflect the Indra arrows and tanked a mastered chidori with Lightspeed to the face, and it didn't even scratch him. He gave the entire Shinobi alliance 3x chakra and shielded them from the fucking juubi and then continued fighting godlevel enemies without a break. \n\nSimilar argument could be made for Sasuke, if they were as strong as they were in the end valley, they'd have beaten jigenbor at least made it really close.

Keep in mind equal doesn't mean they'll draw in a fight. Naruto counters all of Sasukes attacks. Still they are equal. If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",

If you yourself awakened the rinnegan the abilities are much easier and less draining to use as if you'd take someone's eye. It's the reason why Nagato got fucked by using the rinnegan too much while Madara could just spam it even though Nagato probably had more chakra (Uzumaki genes).",

Like if anything it helps my point cuz Sasuke lost most of his power (also the mass amount of chakra to use the rinnegan so much) and Naruto then doubled his Kurama power. It really does only make sense. Sasuke is still almost his speed and danger just obviously not as much chakra.\n\nThe only human on the planet stronger than Sasuke is Naruto, and that gap is massive itself between Sasuke and the rest of the world",

Boruto and Kawaki had to combine both their karma to open the portal once and then a second time to come back to Konoha.

There're a lot of ninja stuff, elemental jutsus are more used, more ninja tools, more plans, etc. Just look at the fights of the Boruto's team 7 and tell me it's not beautiful. Obviously they have to keep powerups because the continuation of the story wants it. One of the focal points of the Boruto series is about tools and how the user is good at using the tools. Hence why Momoshiki got obliterated, hence why ninja tools that reused jutsus were bad but the tools that are here as a bonus rather than compensating, are good. \n\nHopefully karma is the only powerup for Boruto (other than jougan but I think it's filler feature), and I'm confident that they will make him a skilled ninja who uses tactics, not just a chakra nuclear bomb that radiates pure power.",

Naruto and Sasuke are easily *stronger* than they were in Shippuden, however, they are *dumber*, though. Their battle sense is what took a hit, by virtue of them not getting main character plot treatment. They don't use their jutsu the same, they don't have as clever of plans, etc. Could be that they don't feel like taking the time and money necessary to give them fights that are equally as creative and cool as they were in Shippuden, or that its more of an intentional way to boost the new-gen characters. It wouldn't be compelling if Naruto and Sasuke just destroyed a villain anytime they show up. For the record, I hate that it is the way it is. I wish they would've done more of a 'Korra' thing and set it more in the future so they could protect their legacies and not fuck their power scaling. \n\nAlso, secondly, Isshiki is much stronger than Kaguya. Momoshiki is stronger than Kaguya, and we also can observe that Isshiki is much stronger than Momoshiki. Momoshiki has some weird scaling, but it seems like it can be attributed to bad writing. Kaguya definitely has had the most hax out of any Otsutsuki, but it doesn't make her the strongest. The guy who can (after 1 amp) kick Sasuke out of his PS and Naruto out of his Kurama avatar is. The guy who shit on Naruto and Sasuke is.\n\nWithout getting too much into it, you're stuck in Shippuden if you think Naruto and Sasuke wouldn't neg their younger counterparts.

End of Shippuden Sasuke and Naruto are objectively better out of the simple reason that both have their arms and Sasuke has all of the tailed beasts chakra, while Naruto has the truth seeking orbs. \n\nAlso Kishimoto literally said in an interview that Naruto got weaker, because he's out of shape.\nSad to see you become the very thing you accuse me off.\n\nLastly i want to add that i find Boruto's story line (or at least the anime adaptation, as i have yet to read it's manga counterpart) to be far inferior to any of Narutos arcs which is why idgaf about the fact that they lost bcs thwyr no longer the MCs. I understand that, doesn't mean I like it. In a debate disregarding plot consequences, they're clearly weaker.",

In the fight against Sasuke he used 2 ninja nukes to deflect the Indra arrows and tanked a mastered chidori with Lightspeed to the face, and it didn't even scratch him. He gave the entire Shinobi alliance 3x chakra and shielded them from the fucking juubi and then continued fighting godlevel enemies without a break. \n\nSimilar argument could be made for Sasuke, if they were as strong as they were in the end valley, they'd have beaten jigenbor at least made it really close.

Keep in mind equal doesn't mean they'll draw in a fight. Naruto counters all of Sasukes attacks. Still they are equal. If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",

If you yourself awakened the rinnegan the abilities are much easier and less draining to use as if you'd take someone's eye. It's the reason why Nagato got fucked by using the rinnegan too much while Madara could just spam it even though Nagato probably had more chakra (Uzumaki genes).",

Secondly, Otsutsukis don't seem to need chakra for traveling between dimensions, you saw Kaguya opening portals all the time so it's pretty normal if a vessel of an Otsutsuki with the karma is able to do that as well. It's hilarious how some people get mad at this but not at the sharigan always getting a new feature out of nowhere just to buff Sasuke and the Uchihas in general.",

Karma vessels don't magically receive massive chakra pools, Otsutsuki's are not tailed beasts. \n\nI'm not a fan of random powers up either, that's why i prefer naruto og to shippuden.

Boruto and Kawaki had to combine both their karma to open the portal once and then a second time to come back to Konoha. This is pretty fine compared to a \"real\" Otsutsuki like Kaguya still spamming portals. \n\nAlso Boruto is much much closer to og Naruto than Shippuden. There're a lot of ninja stuff, elemental jutsus are more used, more ninja tools, more plans, etc. Just look at the fights of the Boruto's team 7 and tell me it's not beautiful. Obviously they have to keep powerups because the continuation of the story wants it. One of the focal points of the Boruto series is about tools and how the user is good at using the tools. Hence why Momoshiki got obliterated, hence why ninja tools that reused jutsus were bad but the tools that are here as a bonus rather than compensating, are good. \n\nHopefully karma is the only powerup for Boruto (other than jougan but I think it's filler feature), and I'm confident that they will make him a skilled ninja who uses tactics, not just a chakra nuclear bomb that radiates pure power.",

Naruto and Sasuke are easily *stronger* than they were in Shippuden, however, they are *dumber*, though. Their battle sense is what took a hit, by virtue of them not getting main character plot treatment. They don't use their jutsu the same, they don't have as clever of plans, etc. Could be that they don't feel like taking the time and money necessary to give them fights that are equally as creative and cool as they were in Shippuden, or that its more of an intentional way to boost the new-gen characters. It wouldn't be compelling if Naruto and Sasuke just destroyed a villain anytime they show up. For the record, I hate that it is the way it is. I wish they would've done more of a 'Korra' thing and set it more in the future so they could protect their legacies and not fuck their power scaling. \n\nAlso, secondly, Isshiki is much stronger than Kaguya. Momoshiki is stronger than Kaguya, and we also can observe that Isshiki is much stronger than Momoshiki. Momoshiki has some weird scaling, but it seems like it can be attributed to bad writing. Kaguya definitely has had the most hax out of any Otsutsuki, but it doesn't make her the strongest. The guy who can (after 1 amp) kick Sasuke out of his PS and Naruto out of his Kurama avatar is. The guy who shit on Naruto and Sasuke is.\n\nWithout getting too much into it, you're stuck in Shippuden if you think Naruto and Sasuke wouldn't neg their younger counterparts.

End of Shippuden Sasuke and Naruto are objectively better out of the simple reason that both have their arms and Sasuke has all of the tailed beasts chakra, while Naruto has the truth seeking orbs. \n\nAlso Kishimoto literally said in an interview that Naruto got weaker, because he's out of shape.\nSad to see you become the very thing you accuse me off.\n\nLastly i want to add that i find Boruto's story line (or at least the anime adaptation, as i have yet to read it's manga counterpart) to be far inferior to any of Narutos arcs which is why idgaf about the fact that they lost bcs thwyr no longer the MCs. I understand that, doesn't mean I like it. In a debate disregarding plot consequences, they're clearly weaker.",

In the fight against Sasuke he used 2 ninja nukes to deflect the Indra arrows and tanked a mastered chidori with Lightspeed to the face, and it didn't even scratch him.

Keep in mind equal doesn't mean they'll draw in a fight. Naruto counters all of Sasukes attacks. Still they are equal. If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",

If you yourself awakened the rinnegan the abilities are much easier and less draining to use as if you'd take someone's eye. It's the reason why Nagato got fucked by using the rinnegan too much while Madara could just spam it even though Nagato probably had more chakra (Uzumaki genes).",

Boruto and Kawaki had to combine both their karma to open the portal once and then a second time to come back to Konoha. This is pretty fine compared to a \"real\" Otsutsuki like Kaguya still spamming portals. \n\nAlso Boruto is much much closer to og Naruto than Shippuden. There're a lot of ninja stuff, elemental jutsus are more used, more ninja tools, more plans, etc. Just look at the fights of the Boruto's team 7 and tell me it's not beautiful. Obviously they have to keep powerups because the continuation of the story wants it. One of the focal points of the Boruto series is about tools and how the user is good at using the tools. Hence why Momoshiki got obliterated, hence why ninja tools that reused jutsus were bad but the tools that are here as a bonus rather than compensating, are good. \n\nHopefully karma is the only powerup for Boruto (other than jougan but I think it's filler feature), and I'm confident that they will make him a skilled ninja who uses tactics, not just a chakra nuclear bomb that radiates pure power.",

Naruto and Sasuke are easily *stronger* than they were in Shippuden, however, they are *dumber*, though. Their battle sense is what took a hit, by virtue of them not getting main character plot treatment. They don't use their jutsu the same, they don't have as clever of plans, etc. Could be that they don't feel like taking the time and money necessary to give them fights that are equally as creative and cool as they were in Shippuden, or that its more of an intentional way to boost the new-gen characters. It wouldn't be compelling if Naruto and Sasuke just destroyed a villain anytime they show up. For the record, I hate that it is the way it is. I wish they would've done more of a 'Korra' thing and set it more in the future so they could protect their legacies and not fuck their power scaling. \n\nAlso, secondly, Isshiki is much stronger than Kaguya. Momoshiki is stronger than Kaguya, and we also can observe that Isshiki is much stronger than Momoshiki. Momoshiki has some weird scaling, but it seems like it can be attributed to bad writing. Kaguya definitely has had the most hax out of any Otsutsuki, but it doesn't make her the strongest. The guy who can (after 1 amp) kick Sasuke out of his PS and Naruto out of his Kurama avatar is. The guy who shit on Naruto and Sasuke is.\n\nWithout getting too much into it, you're stuck in Shippuden if you think Naruto and Sasuke wouldn't neg their younger counterparts.

End of Shippuden Sasuke and Naruto are objectively better out of the simple reason that both have their arms and Sasuke has all of the tailed beasts chakra, while Naruto has the truth seeking orbs. \n\nAlso Kishimoto literally said in an interview that Naruto got weaker, because he's out of shape.\nSad to see you become the very thing you accuse me off.\n\nLastly i want to add that i find Boruto's story line (or at least the anime adaptation, as i have yet to read it's manga counterpart) to be far inferior to any of Narutos arcs which is why idgaf about the fact that they lost bcs thwyr no longer the MCs.

Keep in mind equal doesn't mean they'll draw in a fight. Naruto counters all of Sasukes attacks. Still they are equal. If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",

If you yourself awakened the rinnegan the abilities are much easier and less draining to use as if you'd take someone's eye. It's the reason why Nagato got fucked by using the rinnegan too much while Madara could just spam it even though Nagato probably had more chakra (Uzumaki genes).",

Boruto and Kawaki had to combine both their karma to open the portal once and then a second time to come back to Konoha. This is pretty fine compared to a \"real\" Otsutsuki like Kaguya still spamming portals. \n\nAlso Boruto is much much closer to og Naruto than Shippuden. There're a lot of ninja stuff, elemental jutsus are more used, more ninja tools, more plans, etc. Just look at the fights of the Boruto's team 7 and tell me it's not beautiful. Obviously they have to keep powerups because the continuation of the story wants it. One of the focal points of the Boruto series is about tools and how the user is good at using the tools. Hence why Momoshiki got obliterated, hence why ninja tools that reused jutsus were bad but the tools that are here as a bonus rather than compensating, are good. \n\nHopefully karma is the only powerup for Boruto (other than jougan but I think it's filler feature), and I'm confident that they will make him a skilled ninja who uses tactics, not just a chakra nuclear bomb that radiates pure power.",

Naruto and Sasuke are easily *stronger* than they were in Shippuden, however, they are *dumber*, though. Their battle sense is what took a hit, by virtue of them not getting main character plot treatment. They don't use their jutsu the same, they don't have as clever of plans, etc. Could be that they don't feel like taking the time and money necessary to give them fights that are equally as creative and cool as they were in Shippuden, or that its more of an intentional way to boost the new-gen characters. It wouldn't be compelling if Naruto and Sasuke just destroyed a villain anytime they show up. For the record, I hate that it is the way it is. I wish they would've done more of a 'Korra' thing and set it more in the future so they could protect their legacies and not fuck their power scaling. \n\nAlso, secondly, Isshiki is much stronger than Kaguya. Momoshiki is stronger than Kaguya, and we also can observe that Isshiki is much stronger than Momoshiki. Momoshiki has some weird scaling, but it seems like it can be attributed to bad writing. Kaguya definitely has had the most hax out of any Otsutsuki, but it doesn't make her the strongest. The guy who can (after 1 amp) kick Sasuke out of his PS and Naruto out of his Kurama avatar is. The guy who shit on Naruto and Sasuke is.\n\nWithout getting too much into it, you're stuck in Shippuden if you think Naruto and Sasuke wouldn't neg their younger counterparts.

End of Shippuden Sasuke and Naruto are objectively better out of the simple reason that both have their arms and Sasuke has all of the tailed beasts chakra, while Naruto has the truth seeking orbs. \n\nAlso Kishimoto literally said in an interview that Naruto got weaker, because he's out of shape.\nSad to see you become the very thing you accuse me off.\n\nLastly i want to add that i find Boruto's story line (or at least the anime adaptation, as i have yet to read it's manga counterpart) to be far inferior to any of Narutos arcs which is why idgaf about the fact that they lost bcs thwyr no longer the MCs. I understand that, doesn't mean I like it. In a debate disregarding plot consequences, they're clearly weaker.",

In the fight against Sasuke he used 2 ninja nukes to deflect the Indra arrows and tanked a mastered chidori with Lightspeed to the face, and it didn't even scratch him. He gave the entire Shinobi alliance 3x chakra and shielded them from the fucking juubi and then continued fighting godlevel enemies without a break. \n\nSimilar argument could be made for Sasuke, if they were as strong as they were in the end valley, they'd have beaten jigenbor at least made it really close.

Keep in mind equal doesn't mean they'll draw in a fight. Naruto counters all of Sasukes attacks. Still they are equal. If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",

If you yourself awakened the rinnegan the abilities are much easier and less draining to use as if you'd take someone's eye. It's the reason why Nagato got fucked by using the rinnegan too much while Madara could just spam it even though Nagato probably had more chakra (Uzumaki genes).",

Sasuke in Boruto uses amaterasu twice and then says \"I'm oUt Of ChAkRa\". You kidding me? \n\nSincere question, did you even read/watch Naruto or did you start with Boruto?

Sasuke is still almost his speed and danger just obviously not as much chakra.\n\nThe only human on the planet stronger than Sasuke is Naruto, and that gap is massive itself between Sasuke and the rest of the world",

Naruto and Sasuke are easily *stronger* than they were in Shippuden, however, they are *dumber*, though. Their battle sense is what took a hit, by virtue of them not getting main character plot treatment. They don't use their jutsu the same, they don't have as clever of plans, etc. Could be that they don't feel like taking the time and money necessary to give them fights that are equally as creative and cool as they were in Shippuden, or that its more of an intentional way to boost the new-gen characters. It wouldn't be compelling if Naruto and Sasuke just destroyed a villain anytime they show up. For the record, I hate that it is the way it is. I wish they would've done more of a 'Korra' thing and set it more in the future so they could protect their legacies and not fuck their power scaling. \n\nAlso, secondly, Isshiki is much stronger than Kaguya. Momoshiki is stronger than Kaguya, and we also can observe that Isshiki is much stronger than Momoshiki. Momoshiki has some weird scaling, but it seems like it can be attributed to bad writing. Kaguya definitely has had the most hax out of any Otsutsuki, but it doesn't make her the strongest. The guy who can (after 1 amp) kick Sasuke out of his PS and Naruto out of his Kurama avatar is. The guy who shit on Naruto and Sasuke is.\n\nWithout getting too much into it, you're stuck in Shippuden if you think Naruto and Sasuke wouldn't neg their younger counterparts.

End of Shippuden Sasuke and Naruto are objectively better out of the simple reason that both have their arms and Sasuke has all of the tailed beasts chakra, while Naruto has the truth seeking orbs. \n\nAlso Kishimoto literally said in an interview that Naruto got weaker, because he's out of shape.\nSad to see you become the very thing you accuse me off.\n\nLastly i want to add that i find Boruto's story line (or at least the anime adaptation, as i have yet to read it's manga counterpart) to be far inferior to any of Narutos arcs which is why idgaf about the fact that they lost bcs thwyr no longer the MCs.

Naruto counters all of Sasukes attacks. Still they are equal. If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",

If you yourself awakened the rinnegan the abilities are much easier and less draining to use as if you'd take someone's eye. It's the reason why Nagato got fucked by using the rinnegan too much while Madara could just spam it even though Nagato probably had more chakra (Uzumaki genes).",

Sasuke in Boruto uses amaterasu twice and then says \"I'm oUt Of ChAkRa\". You kidding me? \n\nSincere question, did you even read/watch Naruto or did you start with Boruto?

Naruto and Sasuke are easily *stronger* than they were in Shippuden, however, they are *dumber*, though. Their battle sense is what took a hit, by virtue of them not getting main character plot treatment. They don't use their jutsu the same, they don't have as clever of plans, etc. Could be that they don't feel like taking the time and money necessary to give them fights that are equally as creative and cool as they were in Shippuden, or that its more of an intentional way to boost the new-gen characters. It wouldn't be compelling if Naruto and Sasuke just destroyed a villain anytime they show up. For the record, I hate that it is the way it is. I wish they would've done more of a 'Korra' thing and set it more in the future so they could protect their legacies and not fuck their power scaling. \n\nAlso, secondly, Isshiki is much stronger than Kaguya. Momoshiki is stronger than Kaguya, and we also can observe that Isshiki is much stronger than Momoshiki. Momoshiki has some weird scaling, but it seems like it can be attributed to bad writing. Kaguya definitely has had the most hax out of any Otsutsuki, but it doesn't make her the strongest. The guy who can (after 1 amp) kick Sasuke out of his PS and Naruto out of his Kurama avatar is. The guy who shit on Naruto and Sasuke is.\n\nWithout getting too much into it, you're stuck in Shippuden if you think Naruto and Sasuke wouldn't neg their younger counterparts. Not close, debate with a wall.",

End of Shippuden Sasuke and Naruto are objectively better out of the simple reason that both have their arms and Sasuke has all of the tailed beasts chakra, while Naruto has the truth seeking orbs. \n\nAlso Kishimoto literally said in an interview that Naruto got weaker, because he's out of shape.\nSad to see you become the very thing you accuse me off.\n\nLastly i want to add that i find Boruto's story line (or at least the anime adaptation, as i have yet to read it's manga counterpart) to be far inferior to any of Narutos arcs which is why idgaf about the fact that they lost bcs thwyr no longer the MCs. I understand that, doesn't mean I like it. In a debate disregarding plot consequences, they're clearly weaker.",

That was KCM 1. SO6P Naruto could do many more which were all strong enough to damage Kaguya and wield the truth seeking orbs. Each one of them is able to while out an entire village in seconds. In the fight against Sasuke he used 2 ninja nukes to deflect the Indra arrows and tanked a mastered chidori with Lightspeed to the face, and it didn't even scratch him. He gave the entire Shinobi alliance 3x chakra and shielded them from the fucking juubi and then continued fighting godlevel enemies without a break. \n\nSimilar argument could be made for Sasuke, if they were as strong as they were in the end valley, they'd have beaten jigenbor at least made it really close.

Naruto counters all of Sasukes attacks. Still they are equal. If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",

If you yourself awakened the rinnegan the abilities are much easier and less draining to use as if you'd take someone's eye. It's the reason why Nagato got fucked by using the rinnegan too much while Madara could just spam it even though Nagato probably had more chakra (Uzumaki genes).",

Not close, debate with a wall.\n\nThis is where you fucked up. End of Shippuden Sasuke and Naruto are objectively better out of the simple reason that both have their arms and Sasuke has all of the tailed beasts chakra, while Naruto has the truth seeking orbs. \n\nAlso Kishimoto literally said in an interview that Naruto got weaker, because he's out of shape.\nSad to see you become the very thing you accuse me off.\n\nLastly i want to add that i find Boruto's story line (or at least the anime adaptation, as i have yet to read it's manga counterpart) to be far inferior to any of Narutos arcs which is why idgaf about the fact that they lost bcs thwyr no longer the MCs. I understand that, doesn't mean I like it. In a debate disregarding plot consequences, they're clearly weaker.",

SO6P Naruto could do many more which were all strong enough to damage Kaguya and wield the truth seeking orbs. Each one of them is able to while out an entire village in seconds. In the fight against Sasuke he used 2 ninja nukes to deflect the Indra arrows and tanked a mastered chidori with Lightspeed to the face, and it didn't even scratch him. He gave the entire Shinobi alliance 3x chakra and shielded them from the fucking juubi and then continued fighting godlevel enemies without a break. \n\nSimilar argument could be made for Sasuke, if they were as strong as they were in the end valley, they'd have beaten jigenbor at least made it really close.

Naruto counters all of Sasukes attacks. Still they are equal. If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",

If you yourself awakened the rinnegan the abilities are much easier and less draining to use as if you'd take someone's eye. It's the reason why Nagato got fucked by using the rinnegan too much while Madara could just spam it even though Nagato probably had more chakra (Uzumaki genes).",

Naruto counters all of Sasukes attacks. Still they are equal. If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",

If you yourself awakened the rinnegan the abilities are much easier and less draining to use as if you'd take someone's eye. It's the reason why Nagato got fucked by using the rinnegan too much while Madara could just spam it even though Nagato probably had more chakra (Uzumaki genes).",

Naruto counters all of Sasukes attacks. Still they are equal. If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",

If you yourself awakened the rinnegan the abilities are much easier and less draining to use as if you'd take someone's eye. It's the reason why Nagato got fucked by using the rinnegan too much while Madara could just spam it even though Nagato probably had more chakra (Uzumaki genes).",

Still they are equal. If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",

Still they are equal. If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",

If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",

If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",

If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",

He said something like itachi helping the good guys would make killing Madara too easy. As of in hed help beat him. But i may be wrong on this one.",

If there was an enemy who wouldn't counter any of their abilities, they'd either both win or both lose. \n\nIn the end of Shippuden they were almost equal too, but Naruto had the upperhand due to being able to play defensively. I don't know if you've watched Star wars but in the fight between Anakin (or more so Darth Vader) against Obi-Wan in ROTS Obi-Wan has no intention of killing his Padawan, at the same time he is the inferior fighter at that point. Yet he wins playing defensively. Basically the same situation but most of Sasukes attacks have little effect in Naruto as he can counter all of them. This doesn't mean he didn't go all out, he went allout defensively, using all he could do so he wouldn't die. They werent 100% equal but in Boruto they are. \n\n\nKishimoto may have questionable opinions sometimes, but he is the writer and therefore knows his work better than anyone. What he says is cannon after all. \n\nSasukes left arm was literally his main arm. Imagine you're a swordsman and lose your swordhand. Yes that's a nerf. The fact that he is still relatively good with his other hand proves that he trained in that time proving what kishimoto said about them.\n\nKinshiki also isn't that impressive apart from his strength. He's nothing compared to Juubimadara or End valley Naruto. So this isnt the best Sasuke could do.",
