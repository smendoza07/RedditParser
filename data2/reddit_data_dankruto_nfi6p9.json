He had to rely on using air bursts to attack Madara because he still wasn't fast enough to touch him directly untill the end.  If he put on weights it likely would decrease his speed which would reduce the effectiveness of his air bursts attacks since they largely rely on speed. He could use his punches still but his overall movement speed would be reduced which he had a tough time compensating for as it is during the fight. And as we saw with the Gara vs Rock Lee fight if you don't have the speed to touch your opponent in the end your attacks won't matter.",

That's still an argument from ignorance since you're using the lack of evidence to make an assertion of a possibility.\nBy your 2 degree logic, I could say every character in naruto could be wearing weights (it's never said they aren't), including Madara, putting them on equal footing.

But moving those weights at the speed he does means a ridiculous amount of energy is in each one. Simply accelerating that mass to the speed of a \"regular\" (by ninja standards i guess) kick means he has the equivalent force of whatever a normal kick is + all that weight behind it + the extra energy he needed to move and accelerate all that weight. I feel intuitively like it would be similar to being hit by a truck lol",

Even if he could, he would likely not have a lot of control and his legs may even snap from the forward force caused by the mass of the weights. Sure, trucks are heavy, but force is mass and acceleration, which is why a stationary truck won't crush something in front of it. Essentially I'm saying that the strength of the kick would depend on the force of it, not the mass of his leg.",

He had to rely on using air bursts to attack Madara because he still wasn't fast enough to touch him directly untill the end.  If he put on weights it likely would decrease his speed which would reduce the effectiveness of his air bursts attacks since they largely rely on speed. He could use his punches still but his overall movement speed would be reduced which he had a tough time compensating for as it is during the fight. And as we saw with the Gara vs Rock Lee fight if you don't have the speed to touch your opponent in the end your attacks won't matter.",

That's still an argument from ignorance since you're using the lack of evidence to make an assertion of a possibility.\nBy your 2 degree logic, I could say every character in naruto could be wearing weights (it's never said they aren't), including Madara, putting them on equal footing. It's just as likely, using your logic.\n\nIn fact, Madara's weights could be 100x as heavy as Gai's. Now imagine if he took them off. \nYou cant prove that's not true, so it's possible.",

Even if he could, he would likely not have a lot of control and his legs may even snap from the forward force caused by the mass of the weights. Sure, trucks are heavy, but force is mass and acceleration, which is why a stationary truck won't crush something in front of it.

That's still an argument from ignorance since you're using the lack of evidence to make an assertion of a possibility.\nBy your 2 degree logic, I could say every character in naruto could be wearing weights (it's never said they aren't), including Madara, putting them on equal footing. It's just as likely, using your logic.\n\nIn fact, Madara's weights could be 100x as heavy as Gai's. Now imagine if he took them off. \nYou cant prove that's not true, so it's possible.",

If he put on weights it likely would decrease his speed which would reduce the effectiveness of his air bursts attacks since they largely rely on speed. He could use his punches still but his overall movement speed would be reduced which he had a tough time compensating for as it is during the fight. And as we saw with the Gara vs Rock Lee fight if you don't have the speed to touch your opponent in the end your attacks won't matter.",

That's still an argument from ignorance since you're using the lack of evidence to make an assertion of a possibility.\nBy your 2 degree logic, I could say every character in naruto could be wearing weights (it's never said they aren't), including Madara, putting them on equal footing. It's just as likely, using your logic.\n\nIn fact, Madara's weights could be 100x as heavy as Gai's. Now imagine if he took them off. \nYou cant prove that's not true, so it's possible.",

Sure, trucks are heavy, but force is mass and acceleration, which is why a stationary truck won't crush something in front of it.

That's still an argument from ignorance since you're using the lack of evidence to make an assertion of a possibility.\nBy your 2 degree logic, I could say every character in naruto could be wearing weights (it's never said they aren't), including Madara, putting them on equal footing. It's just as likely, using your logic.\n\nIn fact, Madara's weights could be 100x as heavy as Gai's. Now imagine if he took them off. \nYou cant prove that's not true, so it's possible.",

That's still an argument from ignorance since you're using the lack of evidence to make an assertion of a possibility.\nBy your 2 degree logic, I could say every character in naruto could be wearing weights (it's never said they aren't), including Madara, putting them on equal footing. It's just as likely, using your logic.\n\nIn fact, Madara's weights could be 100x as heavy as Gai's. Now imagine if he took them off. \nYou cant prove that's not true, so it's possible.",

Your 2 degrees might not be enough, you'd know this if you had 10 degrees like me (you have no evidence to conclude I don't,  therefore I might). \n\nSince you've spent the last whatever amount of time googling burden of proof, you may as well google Russell's teapot, and as you'll learn, you have the burden of proof for existence of something, not the burden of disproof as that can be impossible in certain contexts.\n\nNow you might say \"but bla bla bla, that just means we don't know if he's wearing weights, so he might bla bla bla\". \nNow, now, hold your horses there mr/ms 2 degrees, what you're effectively doing there is committing a logical fallacy (which I'm sure you did your thesis on) called argument from ignorance. \n\n\"But mi mi mi, all I'm saying is he might be wearing them not that he is mi mi mi\"\n\nCalm down, jeez. That's still an argument from ignorance since you're using the lack of evidence to make an assertion of a possibility.\nBy your 2 degree logic, I could say every character in naruto could be wearing weights (it's never said they aren't), including Madara, putting them on equal footing. It's just as likely, using your logic.\n\nIn fact, Madara's weights could be 100x as heavy as Gai's. Now imagine if he took them off. \nYou cant prove that's not true, so it's possible.",
