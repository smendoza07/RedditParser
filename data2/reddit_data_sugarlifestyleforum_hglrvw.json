Don\u2019t be desperate and have some dignity please. \nOf course we all need some sugar to sparkle our lives and make it a bit better but please keep it mind that it\u2019s a win win situation so don\u2019t beg or expect to get something when you don\u2019t even give. \n\nlastly, don\u2019t enter the bowl if you are desperate or have an emergency. Sugaring isn\u2019t the immediate solution to problems. \n\nThank you for reading",

You know, those kinds of things must happen because Becky said so on her channel and she has over 800 followers. \ud83d\ude12\n\nNone of them expect to do anything more than sit there and look pretty and get handed cash for every time she says \u201cdaddy.\u201d And they all end up here with the \u201cwhat am I doing wrong, I\u2019ve been on SA for a whole week, I have rent to pay tomorrow!!\u201d Grow some emotional intelligence or fly away little bird. \ud83d\ude02\n\nEdits: the word Android was changed to the originally intended \u201cand for,\u201d a beginning quotation mark was added in the last paragraph, and the name Cindy was changed to Becky for posterity, lol.",

Yes, those who say \"I need XXX for a M&G\" get nexted.  If we're getting along well before a M&G and a POT says \"Hey, could you maybe help me out with some money for gas? It's kinda far for me.\"  Which sometimes it legitimately was, then after the M&G I'd give them a little something (ie - an amount that would cover a tank of gas without issue.  Heck, one legitimately asked if she could follow me to a gas station after the M&G so I could fill up her car).  Or, I would e-gift them an uber/lyft gift card if they really seemed sincere (only once did a POT not show up when I did that pre-M&G).\n\nBut yes, the illusion of \"You too can get an LV bag in under a week just by sending pics\" is not what the arrangement is about.
