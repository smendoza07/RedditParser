Traditionally, they want to give me an undercut, completely buzzing the sides, and leaving me with a harsh transition into the long top. I end up looking like a Walmart brad pit from Fury.\n\nOr, they barely fade the sides and it just looks like a standard trim up.\n\nFor this cut, I had to specifically ask the stylist to do a low skin fade while keeping the upper sides long and fading them with scissors so that it gradually transitions into the top. I think she used a comb with clippers but it worked the same.\n\nWhen I asked if anyone ever asks for something similar she said no. Is this cut really that uncommon? Is there a name for it?",
