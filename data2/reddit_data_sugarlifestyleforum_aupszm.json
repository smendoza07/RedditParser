    "body": "It occurs to me as I\u2019ve read many posts recently that perhaps some of the problems SBs are encountering is because of poorly written biographies. Understanding the steps in attracting the \u201cright\u201d SD can definitely be helpful, and I\u2019m a firm believer that an improvement in the \u201cmarketing\u201d will always positively affect the end relationships. I\u2019ve had some success with SA, and I hope my advice will offer some guidance and open a discussion for those ladies feeling frustrated or disappointed. I\u2019m happy to chime in with advice or revisions and tweaking of your bio, if you like. \n\nMy experiences have ranged from a paid platonic dinners for companionship, long term but sporadic meetings to accommodate business travel, long weekends away, to monthly allowances paid regardless of his ability to meet, to all monthly expenses paid and a generous clothing budget allowance. Why have I been successful and others not? I\u2019m certain I am absolutely not the most beautiful woman here, but I have learned what works for me\u2014and I\u2019d like to share. \n\nMy mindset, and I\u2019m upfront here and on SA, is that this endeavor should be taken on as an adventure and treated as a side business. I realize that will ruffle some feathers, but it\u2019s the best working metaphor I can offer (pun intended). \n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning. What brings me here? The economics of having good taste, a COMPLETE lack of tolerance for lies or games, and a very high sex drive. That said, I am extremely cautious and discriminating.  By that, mean I know I\u2019m not every Seekers cup of tea. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t want to be. I understand finding a fit that works for us both and offers shared chemistry and workable geography will take time. I\u2019ve had three long term, emotionally fulfilling and mutually beneficial relationships from this site. I can even offer references! \n\nThat being said, I understand completely my place in my SDs life is as entertainment, therapy, and stress relief. My photos show my face, shape and assets. No nudes. And, I won\u2019t send them until we have an established agreement and have met in person. I do have professional lingerie shots. They aren\u2019t photoshopped. My profile is polite and very specific. Remember ladies, this is essentially your resume. The goal of a good resume is to highlight your talents, passions and give an idea of the atmosphere in which you hope to thrive. The goal of a good resume is to be offered a M&G, and to have established a bit of rapport to know you WANT to know more about the possibility of an agreement. The M&G is closely related to the job interview. Here, you also (the SB) are checking for a level of attraction, rapport and chemistry. You want to feel safe and also coveted. That\u2019s the fun! \n\nMy best advice: Be real, Be Authentic and give and deserve Respect. \n\nIs there a dark side? Absolutely. In short ladies: be prepared for some scams, rude requests, and sourpuss SDs who can\u2019t afford you. Laugh it off and don\u2019t let it dissuade you. \n\nKeep your safety as priority #1. Set up a way to communicate that is NOT your phone number. Kik or TextFree or a burner number. Discuss Sexual Safety upfront. Have an app on your phone that knows your location and you can use passively. (I like Noonlight). Uber to and from your first meetings, if possible, or have a discrete friend drop you off and then leave to wait nearby or check in later. Always have one person who knows your location and when you\u2019ll check in.\n\nBe on time, and look amazing. If you\u2019re nervous, be upfront. He is too, even if he\u2019s had more experience. Smile. Speak about things you both enjoy (movies, music, travel) and very gently introduce touch (if it feels right to you). Always, listen to your instincts. Are you having fun, enjoying the spark of anticipation? Can you flirt and enjoy each other\u2019s company? \n\nIf your body says NO, listen to it. Your intuition is a gift. \n\nCompartmentalize your *value* and never mistake it for your *worth*.  \n\nAct like a lady and never accept treatment that demeans you. The block feature is your friend. You are offering a service, companionship, affection and discretion. Your time is valuable. So is his. Happy seeking! ",

It just feels frustrating and funny when you come across an SD's profile that wants a SB who is a \"lady/classy,\" but then demand to see nudes with your face cropped out before even meeting (and then claim its not personal nudes because your face is cropped out!?!?!1!). Then when you say no, they get hissy and call you a narcissist. Like, wut? Proceeded to block and report that bitter/angsty guy. I'm just trying to stay positive, but I am glad I didn't break my resolve.",

I don\u2019t even do that in Photoshop, I use Lightroom. That\u2019s just finishing the photo in post, it\u2019s standard work flow. I\u2019d never give a client a raw photo.\n\nActual photoshopping done in Photoshop would be where I\u2019d fix things like under-eye circles, sun damage, cellulite and wrinkles, drastically uneven skin tones, scars, \u201ccontouring\u201d, and Frankenstein body parts together if necessary. That\u2019s gonna cost extra. But it\u2019s also seriously overboard for most people, unless they\u2019re going in a magazine of course. \n\nTo be honest, a good photographer can make someone look 10x better than they do in real life without spending a single minute in Photoshop. Lens choice, aperture, lighting, angles, setting, makeup, clothing, eliciting certain expressions, moods, and poses. Those things are so much more important than photoshopping. THAT is why you hire a photographer. Otherwise any idiot with an Adobe account can make your pores and wrinkles disappear from your phone selfies. They\u2019re not comparable :)\n\nTl;dr People hire photographers to get professional photos, not to get photoshopped photos",

Small things like removing blemishes or taking away a stray hair that\u2019s falling across your cheek, or removing a bit of stubble/razor burn. (Unless you specifically request they not do that, and some don\u2019t want their work shown unless it\u2019s polished to their usual degree of quality)\n\nI know you mean it colloquially, as in they didn\u2019t morph your body into something it isn\u2019t, but people need to stop using incorrect terminology for this because it just gives cranky dudes ammo.

I have found those who look down on others, because of their present day financials are, most commonly, rather financially restricted themselves. Speaking for myself only: I sometimes feel guilty about my wealth and feel a need to bring others up or secretly contribute towards their potential. (Investing in people is far more liberating than destroying, or unjustifiably humiliating them, in front of others) What I don't ever do is; mimic your terrible attempt at humiliating a person, who also has an enormous amount of drive and potential.\n\nOne day soon, her financial wealth will, mostly likely, surpass yours; as her value portrayed here, already has...",

I don\u2019t even do that in Photoshop, I use Lightroom. That\u2019s just finishing the photo in post, it\u2019s standard work flow. I\u2019d never give a client a raw photo.\n\nActual photoshopping done in Photoshop would be where I\u2019d fix things like under-eye circles, sun damage, cellulite and wrinkles, drastically uneven skin tones, scars, \u201ccontouring\u201d, and Frankenstein body parts together if necessary. That\u2019s gonna cost extra. But it\u2019s also seriously overboard for most people, unless they\u2019re going in a magazine of course. \n\nTo be honest, a good photographer can make someone look 10x better than they do in real life without spending a single minute in Photoshop. Lens choice, aperture, lighting, angles, setting, makeup, clothing, eliciting certain expressions, moods, and poses. Those things are so much more important than photoshopping. THAT is why you hire a photographer. Otherwise any idiot with an Adobe account can make your pores and wrinkles disappear from your phone selfies. They\u2019re not comparable :)\n\nTl;dr People hire photographers to get professional photos, not to get photoshopped photos",
