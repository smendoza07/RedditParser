Here we often think the second someone dies a baby is born with their soul. Over there is possible to have a long period of time between incarnations or a little overlap, where when you die your spirit inhabits an infant or young child.\n\nAlso, their idea of the soul is different than ours. To them, it's not a carrying on of your personhood, but rather a continuation of your karma and general wisdom. Think Avatar the Last Airbender. Each Avatar are wildly different people, but share a karma.",

I don't. I just relay the fact that Madara isn't a great character, and that the War Arc sucks.\n\nNow, this is your response:\n\n>Wow people who have a different opinion then you are morons? Gtfo Madara had like 7 YEARS of build up and when he came out he was an absolute monster that flexed on everybody **it's pretty easy to see why someone would like Madara**\n\nThis is you *completely* missing the point of my comment. *Again*, on my end, the argument was never about whether you're allowed to like Madara; *again*, it was about Madara's *writing*.\n\nI very clearly expressed in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankruto/comments/iornry/_/g4gb07l?context=1000) - which you *still* haven't managed to conjure up a response to - that my issue is with Madara *as a character,* and I then asked you to *respond* to the points *raised* in that post in order to prove me wrong. \n\n*Again*, you never did.\n\n*Our* argument was *never* about whether or not you can *like* Madara (I've very, *very* clearly expressed that I don't give a *fuck* about that) - instead, it was about how *well-written* a *character* Madara is (or at least I *thought* it was).\n\nWhat's *in* that post I've linked are *facts* concerning Madara's station as a character - they're taken *directly from the manga*. *It is not my opinion* that Madara is a shit character, and the examples within that post are there to back me up.\n\nYou've been arguing *irrelevant bullshit this entire* time because *you* misunderstood my comment; until you *look* at those points, and then *prove them wrong*, I stand *incorrected*. If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Those are *facts*, and they aptly explain why I don't like Madara. **Those. Are. Facts.** \n\n>I'm not coming up with counter arguments for that circle jerk hate thread **there are plenty already there**\n\nI find it funny that you'd call that post a \"circle-jerk\" thread considering the *very post we're in.*\n\nKeep fucking deluding yourself, man, *nobody* in that post had a good counter-argument, *and you know it.* The OP shut *everyone* of those \"*counter-arguments*\" down with *manga-facts*. \n\nYou're \"not coming up with counter-arguments\" because you fucking *can't*, *moron*, stop lying. Jesus Christ...\n\n>all I'm saying that people who like him aren't morons for liking him\n\nNot relevant to the discussion.\n\n>plenty of other characters do the same thing doesn't mean you can't enjoy them\n\nI agree. That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

Alive Madara was insanely strong even without his Susanoo. Tbh it would be for him part of his \u201clast resort pack\u201d (which includes izanagi). \n\nWithout a shadow of a doubt he could kill at least 3 of the 5 kage without using a Susanoo at all, but when he\u2019s going up agaisnt 4th Raikage and Tsunade he\u2019s gonna need some protection against those 1 hit punches. While he can dodge them easily using nothing but his base sharingan it\u2019s risky to take on 5 kage without any real protection",

Here we often think the second someone dies a baby is born with their soul. Over there is possible to have a long period of time between incarnations or a little overlap, where when you die your spirit inhabits an infant or young child.\n\nAlso, their idea of the soul is different than ours. To them, it's not a carrying on of your personhood, but rather a continuation of your karma and general wisdom. Think Avatar the Last Airbender. Each Avatar are wildly different people, but share a karma.",

I don't. I just relay the fact that Madara isn't a great character, and that the War Arc sucks.\n\nNow, this is your response:\n\n>Wow people who have a different opinion then you are morons? Gtfo Madara had like 7 YEARS of build up and when he came out he was an absolute monster that flexed on everybody **it's pretty easy to see why someone would like Madara**\n\nThis is you *completely* missing the point of my comment. *Again*, on my end, the argument was never about whether you're allowed to like Madara; *again*, it was about Madara's *writing*.\n\nI very clearly expressed in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankruto/comments/iornry/_/g4gb07l?context=1000) - which you *still* haven't managed to conjure up a response to - that my issue is with Madara *as a character,* and I then asked you to *respond* to the points *raised* in that post in order to prove me wrong. \n\n*Again*, you never did.\n\n*Our* argument was *never* about whether or not you can *like* Madara (I've very, *very* clearly expressed that I don't give a *fuck* about that) - instead, it was about how *well-written* a *character* Madara is (or at least I *thought* it was).\n\nWhat's *in* that post I've linked are *facts* concerning Madara's station as a character - they're taken *directly from the manga*. *It is not my opinion* that Madara is a shit character, and the examples within that post are there to back me up.\n\nYou've been arguing *irrelevant bullshit this entire* time because *you* misunderstood my comment; until you *look* at those points, and then *prove them wrong*, I stand *incorrected*. If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Those are *facts*, and they aptly explain why I don't like Madara. **Those. Are. Facts.** \n\n>I'm not coming up with counter arguments for that circle jerk hate thread **there are plenty already there**\n\nI find it funny that you'd call that post a \"circle-jerk\" thread considering the *very post we're in.*\n\nKeep fucking deluding yourself, man, *nobody* in that post had a good counter-argument, *and you know it.* The OP shut *everyone* of those \"*counter-arguments*\" down with *manga-facts*. \n\nYou're \"not coming up with counter-arguments\" because you fucking *can't*, *moron*, stop lying. Jesus Christ...\n\n>all I'm saying that people who like him aren't morons for liking him\n\nNot relevant to the discussion.\n\n>plenty of other characters do the same thing doesn't mean you can't enjoy them\n\nI agree. That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

Also Madara knew the reanimation Jutsu which was also invented by the 2nd Hokage so that point is invalid.\n\nAnd using clones against Hashirama would be pointless for two reasons: 1. Hashirama has more chakra reserves/higher chakra regen, so he could outlast him if Madara sank soo much chakra into the clones (whereas the 5 kage could not outlast Madara\u2019s chakra), and then Hashirama would pull out an equal amount of wood clones, which as I stated previously are superior to all other clones barring limbo.",

Over there is possible to have a long period of time between incarnations or a little overlap, where when you die your spirit inhabits an infant or young child.\n\nAlso, their idea of the soul is different than ours. To them, it's not a carrying on of your personhood, but rather a continuation of your karma and general wisdom. Think Avatar the Last Airbender. Each Avatar are wildly different people, but share a karma.",

I don't. I just relay the fact that Madara isn't a great character, and that the War Arc sucks.\n\nNow, this is your response:\n\n>Wow people who have a different opinion then you are morons? Gtfo Madara had like 7 YEARS of build up and when he came out he was an absolute monster that flexed on everybody **it's pretty easy to see why someone would like Madara**\n\nThis is you *completely* missing the point of my comment. *Again*, on my end, the argument was never about whether you're allowed to like Madara; *again*, it was about Madara's *writing*.\n\nI very clearly expressed in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankruto/comments/iornry/_/g4gb07l?context=1000) - which you *still* haven't managed to conjure up a response to - that my issue is with Madara *as a character,* and I then asked you to *respond* to the points *raised* in that post in order to prove me wrong. \n\n*Again*, you never did.\n\n*Our* argument was *never* about whether or not you can *like* Madara (I've very, *very* clearly expressed that I don't give a *fuck* about that) - instead, it was about how *well-written* a *character* Madara is (or at least I *thought* it was).\n\nWhat's *in* that post I've linked are *facts* concerning Madara's station as a character - they're taken *directly from the manga*. *It is not my opinion* that Madara is a shit character, and the examples within that post are there to back me up.\n\nYou've been arguing *irrelevant bullshit this entire* time because *you* misunderstood my comment; until you *look* at those points, and then *prove them wrong*, I stand *incorrected*. If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

Over there is possible to have a long period of time between incarnations or a little overlap, where when you die your spirit inhabits an infant or young child.\n\nAlso, their idea of the soul is different than ours. To them, it's not a carrying on of your personhood, but rather a continuation of your karma and general wisdom. Think Avatar the Last Airbender.

I don't. I just relay the fact that Madara isn't a great character, and that the War Arc sucks.\n\nNow, this is your response:\n\n>Wow people who have a different opinion then you are morons? Gtfo Madara had like 7 YEARS of build up and when he came out he was an absolute monster that flexed on everybody **it's pretty easy to see why someone would like Madara**\n\nThis is you *completely* missing the point of my comment. *Again*, on my end, the argument was never about whether you're allowed to like Madara; *again*, it was about Madara's *writing*.\n\nI very clearly expressed in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankruto/comments/iornry/_/g4gb07l?context=1000) - which you *still* haven't managed to conjure up a response to - that my issue is with Madara *as a character,* and I then asked you to *respond* to the points *raised* in that post in order to prove me wrong. \n\n*Again*, you never did.\n\n*Our* argument was *never* about whether or not you can *like* Madara (I've very, *very* clearly expressed that I don't give a *fuck* about that) - instead, it was about how *well-written* a *character* Madara is (or at least I *thought* it was).\n\nWhat's *in* that post I've linked are *facts* concerning Madara's station as a character - they're taken *directly from the manga*. *It is not my opinion* that Madara is a shit character, and the examples within that post are there to back me up.\n\nYou've been arguing *irrelevant bullshit this entire* time because *you* misunderstood my comment; until you *look* at those points, and then *prove them wrong*, I stand *incorrected*. If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Those are *facts*, and they aptly explain why I don't like Madara. **Those. Are. Facts.** \n\n>I'm not coming up with counter arguments for that circle jerk hate thread **there are plenty already there**\n\nI find it funny that you'd call that post a \"circle-jerk\" thread considering the *very post we're in.*\n\nKeep fucking deluding yourself, man, *nobody* in that post had a good counter-argument, *and you know it.* The OP shut *everyone* of those \"*counter-arguments*\" down with *manga-facts*. \n\nYou're \"not coming up with counter-arguments\" because you fucking *can't*, *moron*, stop lying. Jesus Christ...\n\n>all I'm saying that people who like him aren't morons for liking him\n\nNot relevant to the discussion.\n\n>plenty of other characters do the same thing doesn't mean you can't enjoy them\n\nI agree. That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

Hashirama has more chakra reserves/higher chakra regen, so he could outlast him if Madara sank soo much chakra into the clones (whereas the 5 kage could not outlast Madara\u2019s chakra), and then Hashirama would pull out an equal amount of wood clones, which as I stated previously are superior to all other clones barring limbo.",

Gtfo Madara had like 7 YEARS of build up and when he came out he was an absolute monster that flexed on everybody **it's pretty easy to see why someone would like Madara**\n\nThis is you *completely* missing the point of my comment. *Again*, on my end, the argument was never about whether you're allowed to like Madara; *again*, it was about Madara's *writing*.\n\nI very clearly expressed in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankruto/comments/iornry/_/g4gb07l?context=1000) - which you *still* haven't managed to conjure up a response to - that my issue is with Madara *as a character,* and I then asked you to *respond* to the points *raised* in that post in order to prove me wrong. \n\n*Again*, you never did.\n\n*Our* argument was *never* about whether or not you can *like* Madara (I've very, *very* clearly expressed that I don't give a *fuck* about that) - instead, it was about how *well-written* a *character* Madara is (or at least I *thought* it was).\n\nWhat's *in* that post I've linked are *facts* concerning Madara's station as a character - they're taken *directly from the manga*. *It is not my opinion* that Madara is a shit character, and the examples within that post are there to back me up.\n\nYou've been arguing *irrelevant bullshit this entire* time because *you* misunderstood my comment; until you *look* at those points, and then *prove them wrong*, I stand *incorrected*. If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Facts.** \n\n>I'm not coming up with counter arguments for that circle jerk hate thread **there are plenty already there**\n\nI find it funny that you'd call that post a \"circle-jerk\" thread considering the *very post we're in.*\n\nKeep fucking deluding yourself, man, *nobody* in that post had a good counter-argument, *and you know it.* The OP shut *everyone* of those \"*counter-arguments*\" down with *manga-facts*. \n\nYou're \"not coming up with counter-arguments\" because you fucking *can't*, *moron*, stop lying. Jesus Christ...\n\n>all I'm saying that people who like him aren't morons for liking him\n\nNot relevant to the discussion.\n\n>plenty of other characters do the same thing doesn't mean you can't enjoy them\n\nI agree. That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

While he can dodge them easily using nothing but his base sharingan it\u2019s risky to take on 5 kage without any real protection",

I don't. I just relay the fact that Madara isn't a great character, and that the War Arc sucks.\n\nNow, this is your response:\n\n>Wow people who have a different opinion then you are morons?

If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Facts.** \n\n>I'm not coming up with counter arguments for that circle jerk hate thread **there are plenty already there**\n\nI find it funny that you'd call that post a \"circle-jerk\" thread considering the *very post we're in.*\n\nKeep fucking deluding yourself, man, *nobody* in that post had a good counter-argument, *and you know it.* The OP shut *everyone* of those \"*counter-arguments*\" down with *manga-facts*. \n\nYou're \"not coming up with counter-arguments\" because you fucking *can't*, *moron*, stop lying. Jesus Christ...\n\n>all I'm saying that people who like him aren't morons for liking him\n\nNot relevant to the discussion.\n\n>plenty of other characters do the same thing doesn't mean you can't enjoy them\n\nI agree. That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

Gtfo Madara had like 7 YEARS of build up and when he came out he was an absolute monster that flexed on everybody **it's pretty easy to see why someone would like Madara**\n\nThis is you *completely* missing the point of my comment. *Again*, on my end, the argument was never about whether you're allowed to like Madara; *again*, it was about Madara's *writing*.\n\nI very clearly expressed in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankruto/comments/iornry/_/g4gb07l?context=1000) - which you *still* haven't managed to conjure up a response to - that my issue is with Madara *as a character,* and I then asked you to *respond* to the points *raised* in that post in order to prove me wrong. \n\n*Again*, you never did.\n\n*Our* argument was *never* about whether or not you can *like* Madara (I've very, *very* clearly expressed that I don't give a *fuck* about that) - instead, it was about how *well-written* a *character* Madara is (or at least I *thought* it was).\n\nWhat's *in* that post I've linked are *facts* concerning Madara's station as a character - they're taken *directly from the manga*. *It is not my opinion* that Madara is a shit character, and the examples within that post are there to back me up.\n\nYou've been arguing *irrelevant bullshit this entire* time because *you* misunderstood my comment; until you *look* at those points, and then *prove them wrong*, I stand *incorrected*. If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

Gtfo Madara had like 7 YEARS of build up and when he came out he was an absolute monster that flexed on everybody **it's pretty easy to see why someone would like Madara**\n\nThis is you *completely* missing the point of my comment. *Again*, on my end, the argument was never about whether you're allowed to like Madara; *again*, it was about Madara's *writing*.\n\nI very clearly expressed in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankruto/comments/iornry/_/g4gb07l?context=1000) - which you *still* haven't managed to conjure up a response to - that my issue is with Madara *as a character,* and I then asked you to *respond* to the points *raised* in that post in order to prove me wrong. \n\n*Again*, you never did.\n\n*Our* argument was *never* about whether or not you can *like* Madara (I've very, *very* clearly expressed that I don't give a *fuck* about that) - instead, it was about how *well-written* a *character* Madara is (or at least I *thought* it was).\n\nWhat's *in* that post I've linked are *facts* concerning Madara's station as a character - they're taken *directly from the manga*. *It is not my opinion* that Madara is a shit character, and the examples within that post are there to back me up.\n\nYou've been arguing *irrelevant bullshit this entire* time because *you* misunderstood my comment; until you *look* at those points, and then *prove them wrong*, I stand *incorrected*. If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Those are *facts*, and they aptly explain why I don't like Madara. **Those. Are. Facts.** \n\n>I'm not coming up with counter arguments for that circle jerk hate thread **there are plenty already there**\n\nI find it funny that you'd call that post a \"circle-jerk\" thread considering the *very post we're in.*\n\nKeep fucking deluding yourself, man, *nobody* in that post had a good counter-argument, *and you know it.* The OP shut *everyone* of those \"*counter-arguments*\" down with *manga-facts*. \n\nYou're \"not coming up with counter-arguments\" because you fucking *can't*, *moron*, stop lying. Jesus Christ...\n\n>all I'm saying that people who like him aren't morons for liking him\n\nNot relevant to the discussion.\n\n>plenty of other characters do the same thing doesn't mean you can't enjoy them\n\nI agree. That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

While he can dodge them easily using nothing but his base sharingan it\u2019s risky to take on 5 kage without any real protection",

If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Those are *facts*, and they aptly explain why I don't like Madara. **Those. Are. Facts.** \n\n>I'm not coming up with counter arguments for that circle jerk hate thread **there are plenty already there**\n\nI find it funny that you'd call that post a \"circle-jerk\" thread considering the *very post we're in.*\n\nKeep fucking deluding yourself, man, *nobody* in that post had a good counter-argument, *and you know it.* The OP shut *everyone* of those \"*counter-arguments*\" down with *manga-facts*. \n\nYou're \"not coming up with counter-arguments\" because you fucking *can't*, *moron*, stop lying. Jesus Christ...\n\n>all I'm saying that people who like him aren't morons for liking him\n\nNot relevant to the discussion.\n\n>plenty of other characters do the same thing doesn't mean you can't enjoy them\n\nI agree. That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

I don't. I just relay the fact that Madara isn't a great character, and that the War Arc sucks.\n\nNow, this is your response:\n\n>Wow people who have a different opinion then you are morons?

If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

I don't. I just relay the fact that Madara isn't a great character, and that the War Arc sucks.\n\nNow, this is your response:\n\n>Wow people who have a different opinion then you are morons? Gtfo Madara had like 7 YEARS of build up and when he came out he was an absolute monster that flexed on everybody **it's pretty easy to see why someone would like Madara**\n\nThis is you *completely* missing the point of my comment. *Again*, on my end, the argument was never about whether you're allowed to like Madara; *again*, it was about Madara's *writing*.\n\nI very clearly expressed in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankruto/comments/iornry/_/g4gb07l?context=1000) - which you *still* haven't managed to conjure up a response to - that my issue is with Madara *as a character,* and I then asked you to *respond* to the points *raised* in that post in order to prove me wrong. \n\n*Again*, you never did.\n\n*Our* argument was *never* about whether or not you can *like* Madara (I've very, *very* clearly expressed that I don't give a *fuck* about that) - instead, it was about how *well-written* a *character* Madara is (or at least I *thought* it was).\n\nWhat's *in* that post I've linked are *facts* concerning Madara's station as a character - they're taken *directly from the manga*. *It is not my opinion* that Madara is a shit character, and the examples within that post are there to back me up.\n\nYou've been arguing *irrelevant bullshit this entire* time because *you* misunderstood my comment; until you *look* at those points, and then *prove them wrong*, I stand *incorrected*. If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

I don't. I just relay the fact that Madara isn't a great character, and that the War Arc sucks.\n\nNow, this is your response:\n\n>Wow people who have a different opinion then you are morons?

If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.\n\nMaybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.\n\n***\n\n^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^\u2764\u2764\u2764 ^| ^[PSA](https://redd.it/ghcyhj)",

If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Those are *facts*, and they aptly explain why I don't like Madara. **Those. Are. Facts.** \n\n>I'm not coming up with counter arguments for that circle jerk hate thread **there are plenty already there**\n\nI find it funny that you'd call that post a \"circle-jerk\" thread considering the *very post we're in.*\n\nKeep fucking deluding yourself, man, *nobody* in that post had a good counter-argument, *and you know it.* The OP shut *everyone* of those \"*counter-arguments*\" down with *manga-facts*. \n\nYou're \"not coming up with counter-arguments\" because you fucking *can't*, *moron*, stop lying. Jesus Christ...\n\n>all I'm saying that people who like him aren't morons for liking him\n\nNot relevant to the discussion.\n\n>plenty of other characters do the same thing doesn't mean you can't enjoy them\n\nI agree. That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

I don't. I just relay the fact that Madara isn't a great character, and that the War Arc sucks.\n\nNow, this is your response:\n\n>Wow people who have a different opinion then you are morons?

If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Those are *facts*, and they aptly explain why I don't like Madara. **Those. Are. Facts.** \n\n>I'm not coming up with counter arguments for that circle jerk hate thread **there are plenty already there**\n\nI find it funny that you'd call that post a \"circle-jerk\" thread considering the *very post we're in.*\n\nKeep fucking deluding yourself, man, *nobody* in that post had a good counter-argument, *and you know it.* The OP shut *everyone* of those \"*counter-arguments*\" down with *manga-facts*. \n\nYou're \"not coming up with counter-arguments\" because you fucking *can't*, *moron*, stop lying. Jesus Christ...\n\n>all I'm saying that people who like him aren't morons for liking him\n\nNot relevant to the discussion.\n\n>plenty of other characters do the same thing doesn't mean you can't enjoy them\n\nI agree. That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Facts.** \n\n>I'm not coming up with counter arguments for that circle jerk hate thread **there are plenty already there**\n\nI find it funny that you'd call that post a \"circle-jerk\" thread considering the *very post we're in.*\n\nKeep fucking deluding yourself, man, *nobody* in that post had a good counter-argument, *and you know it.* The OP shut *everyone* of those \"*counter-arguments*\" down with *manga-facts*. \n\nYou're \"not coming up with counter-arguments\" because you fucking *can't*, *moron*, stop lying.

That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

I don't. I just relay the fact that Madara isn't a great character, and that the War Arc sucks.\n\nNow, this is your response:\n\n>Wow people who have a different opinion then you are morons? Gtfo Madara had like 7 YEARS of build up and when he came out he was an absolute monster that flexed on everybody **it's pretty easy to see why someone would like Madara**\n\nThis is you *completely* missing the point of my comment. *Again*, on my end, the argument was never about whether you're allowed to like Madara; *again*, it was about Madara's *writing*.\n\nI very clearly expressed in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankruto/comments/iornry/_/g4gb07l?context=1000) - which you *still* haven't managed to conjure up a response to - that my issue is with Madara *as a character,* and I then asked you to *respond* to the points *raised* in that post in order to prove me wrong. \n\n*Again*, you never did.\n\n*Our* argument was *never* about whether or not you can *like* Madara (I've very, *very* clearly expressed that I don't give a *fuck* about that) - instead, it was about how *well-written* a *character* Madara is (or at least I *thought* it was).\n\nWhat's *in* that post I've linked are *facts* concerning Madara's station as a character - they're taken *directly from the manga*. *It is not my opinion* that Madara is a shit character, and the examples within that post are there to back me up.\n\nYou've been arguing *irrelevant bullshit this entire* time because *you* misunderstood my comment; until you *look* at those points, and then *prove them wrong*, I stand *incorrected*. If you think I'm confusing my opinion with objective fact, then go through that post, and then *prove me wrong.*\n\nIf you *can't* do that, then acknowledge that this was all a misunderstanding, and *let's agree to disagree.*",

Those are *facts*, and they aptly explain why I don't like Madara. **Those. Are. Facts.** \n\n>I'm not coming up with counter arguments for that circle jerk hate thread **there are plenty already there**\n\nI find it funny that you'd call that post a \"circle-jerk\" thread considering the *very post we're in.*\n\nKeep fucking deluding yourself, man, *nobody* in that post had a good counter-argument, *and you know it.* The OP shut *everyone* of those \"*counter-arguments*\" down with *manga-facts*. \n\nYou're \"not coming up with counter-arguments\" because you fucking *can't*, *moron*, stop lying. Jesus Christ...\n\n>all I'm saying that people who like him aren't morons for liking him\n\nNot relevant to the discussion.\n\n>plenty of other characters do the same thing doesn't mean you can't enjoy them\n\nI agree. That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

Those are *facts*, and they aptly explain why I don't like Madara. **Those. Are. Facts.** \n\n>I'm not coming up with counter arguments for that circle jerk hate thread **there are plenty already there**\n\nI find it funny that you'd call that post a \"circle-jerk\" thread considering the *very post we're in.*\n\nKeep fucking deluding yourself, man, *nobody* in that post had a good counter-argument, *and you know it.* The OP shut *everyone* of those \"*counter-arguments*\" down with *manga-facts*. \n\nYou're \"not coming up with counter-arguments\" because you fucking *can't*, *moron*, stop lying. Jesus Christ...\n\n>all I'm saying that people who like him aren't morons for liking him\n\nNot relevant to the discussion.\n\n>plenty of other characters do the same thing doesn't mean you can't enjoy them\n\nI agree. That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",

Those are *facts*, and they aptly explain why I don't like Madara. **Those. Are. Facts.** \n\n>I'm not coming up with counter arguments for that circle jerk hate thread **there are plenty already there**\n\nI find it funny that you'd call that post a \"circle-jerk\" thread considering the *very post we're in.*\n\nKeep fucking deluding yourself, man, *nobody* in that post had a good counter-argument, *and you know it.* The OP shut *everyone* of those \"*counter-arguments*\" down with *manga-facts*. \n\nYou're \"not coming up with counter-arguments\" because you fucking *can't*, *moron*, stop lying. Jesus Christ...\n\n>all I'm saying that people who like him aren't morons for liking him\n\nNot relevant to the discussion.\n\n>plenty of other characters do the same thing doesn't mean you can't enjoy them\n\nI agree. That was never my point anyway, like I've said *many fucking times.*\n\n>Btw claiming that your argument isn't about liking Madara and then shitting on people in other comment who do and **calling them morons is saying that you can't like Madara**\n\nNo it isn't. Me calling you a moron for doing/liking something **does not** mean you can't do/like that thing. Clearly, unlike you, I understand the English fucking language on a basic level. All it means is that I think you're dumb - *that's it.*\n\nAlso, I'm not \"claiming\" shit - my argument *isn't* and *was never* about liking Madara - *your dumbass just misunderstood it.*\n\nSince you *refuse* to repond to my *actual fucking argument*, I've really got nothing else to say to you.\n\nJust fuck off already, moron.",
