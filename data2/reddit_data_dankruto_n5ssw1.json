After Naruto expended a lot of Kuramas Chakra already.\n\nSo what we have is a tired ninja with a slightly fatigued Bijuu helping him, against a tired Ninja and eight and a half completely fresh Bijuu powering him.\n\nNot to mention when it comes down to the final clash where they lose their arms, Sasuke drains Naruto of a good chunk of Chakra. Kurama even remarks that Sasuke, \"Took everything you had left.\" Admittedly, not that much. But he also took a bit of Kuramas.\n\nThen, Naruto with a the last vestiges of Chakra that Kurama had left jumps up with a basic Rasengan. Sasuke, using stolen Chakra, jumps down with a Chidori powered by Amaterasu and it still only stalemates.\n\nKeeping all of this in mind, all of these hard facts from the manga, and try to debate me on this.

Kurama even remarks that Sasuke, \"Took everything you had left.\" Admittedly, not that much. But he also took a bit of Kuramas.\n\nThen, Naruto with a the last vestiges of Chakra that Kurama had left jumps up with a basic Rasengan. Sasuke, using stolen Chakra, jumps down with a Chidori powered by Amaterasu and it still only stalemates.\n\nKeeping all of this in mind, all of these hard facts from the manga, and try to debate me on this.

If you had watched the real show, you would have known that it took eight and a half Bijuus worth of Chakra for Sasuke to match Naruto with only one half of a Bijuu. After Naruto expended a lot of Kuramas Chakra already.\n\nSo what we have is a tired ninja with a slightly fatigued Bijuu helping him, against a tired Ninja and eight and a half completely fresh Bijuu powering him.\n\nNot to mention when it comes down to the final clash where they lose their arms, Sasuke drains Naruto of a good chunk of Chakra. Kurama even remarks that Sasuke, \"Took everything you had left.\" Admittedly, not that much. But he also took a bit of Kuramas.\n\nThen, Naruto with a the last vestiges of Chakra that Kurama had left jumps up with a basic Rasengan. Sasuke, using stolen Chakra, jumps down with a Chidori powered by Amaterasu and it still only stalemates.\n\nKeeping all of this in mind, all of these hard facts from the manga, and try to debate me on this.

If you had watched the real show, you would have known that it took eight and a half Bijuus worth of Chakra for Sasuke to match Naruto with only one half of a Bijuu. After Naruto expended a lot of Kuramas Chakra already.\n\nSo what we have is a tired ninja with a slightly fatigued Bijuu helping him, against a tired Ninja and eight and a half completely fresh Bijuu powering him.\n\nNot to mention when it comes down to the final clash where they lose their arms, Sasuke drains Naruto of a good chunk of Chakra. Kurama even remarks that Sasuke, \"Took everything you had left.\" Admittedly, not that much. But he also took a bit of Kuramas.\n\nThen, Naruto with a the last vestiges of Chakra that Kurama had left jumps up with a basic Rasengan. Sasuke, using stolen Chakra, jumps down with a Chidori powered by Amaterasu and it still only stalemates.\n\nKeeping all of this in mind, all of these hard facts from the manga, and try to debate me on this.

If you had watched the real show, you would have known that it took eight and a half Bijuus worth of Chakra for Sasuke to match Naruto with only one half of a Bijuu.

Kurama even remarks that Sasuke, \"Took everything you had left.\" Admittedly, not that much. But he also took a bit of Kuramas.\n\nThen, Naruto with a the last vestiges of Chakra that Kurama had left jumps up with a basic Rasengan. Sasuke, using stolen Chakra, jumps down with a Chidori powered by Amaterasu and it still only stalemates.\n\nKeeping all of this in mind, all of these hard facts from the manga, and try to debate me on this.

If you had watched the real show, you would have known that it took eight and a half Bijuus worth of Chakra for Sasuke to match Naruto with only one half of a Bijuu. After Naruto expended a lot of Kuramas Chakra already.\n\nSo what we have is a tired ninja with a slightly fatigued Bijuu helping him, against a tired Ninja and eight and a half completely fresh Bijuu powering him.\n\nNot to mention when it comes down to the final clash where they lose their arms, Sasuke drains Naruto of a good chunk of Chakra. Kurama even remarks that Sasuke, \"Took everything you had left.\" Admittedly, not that much. But he also took a bit of Kuramas.\n\nThen, Naruto with a the last vestiges of Chakra that Kurama had left jumps up with a basic Rasengan. Sasuke, using stolen Chakra, jumps down with a Chidori powered by Amaterasu and it still only stalemates.\n\nKeeping all of this in mind, all of these hard facts from the manga, and try to debate me on this.

If you had watched the real show, you would have known that it took eight and a half Bijuus worth of Chakra for Sasuke to match Naruto with only one half of a Bijuu. After Naruto expended a lot of Kuramas Chakra already.\n\nSo what we have is a tired ninja with a slightly fatigued Bijuu helping him, against a tired Ninja and eight and a half completely fresh Bijuu powering him.\n\nNot to mention when it comes down to the final clash where they lose their arms, Sasuke drains Naruto of a good chunk of Chakra. Kurama even remarks that Sasuke, \"Took everything you had left.\" Admittedly, not that much. But he also took a bit of Kuramas.\n\nThen, Naruto with a the last vestiges of Chakra that Kurama had left jumps up with a basic Rasengan. Sasuke, using stolen Chakra, jumps down with a Chidori powered by Amaterasu and it still only stalemates.\n\nKeeping all of this in mind, all of these hard facts from the manga, and try to debate me on this. Using facts. Not head canon.",

If you had watched the real show, you would have known that it took eight and a half Bijuus worth of Chakra for Sasuke to match Naruto with only one half of a Bijuu. After Naruto expended a lot of Kuramas Chakra already.\n\nSo what we have is a tired ninja with a slightly fatigued Bijuu helping him, against a tired Ninja and eight and a half completely fresh Bijuu powering him.\n\nNot to mention when it comes down to the final clash where they lose their arms, Sasuke drains Naruto of a good chunk of Chakra. Kurama even remarks that Sasuke, \"Took everything you had left.\" Admittedly, not that much. But he also took a bit of Kuramas.\n\nThen, Naruto with a the last vestiges of Chakra that Kurama had left jumps up with a basic Rasengan. Sasuke, using stolen Chakra, jumps down with a Chidori powered by Amaterasu and it still only stalemates.\n\nKeeping all of this in mind, all of these hard facts from the manga, and try to debate me on this.

If you had watched the real show, you would have known that it took eight and a half Bijuus worth of Chakra for Sasuke to match Naruto with only one half of a Bijuu. After Naruto expended a lot of Kuramas Chakra already.\n\nSo what we have is a tired ninja with a slightly fatigued Bijuu helping him, against a tired Ninja and eight and a half completely fresh Bijuu powering him.\n\nNot to mention when it comes down to the final clash where they lose their arms, Sasuke drains Naruto of a good chunk of Chakra. Kurama even remarks that Sasuke, \"Took everything you had left.\" Admittedly, not that much. But he also took a bit of Kuramas.\n\nThen, Naruto with a the last vestiges of Chakra that Kurama had left jumps up with a basic Rasengan. Sasuke, using stolen Chakra, jumps down with a Chidori powered by Amaterasu and it still only stalemates.\n\nKeeping all of this in mind, all of these hard facts from the manga, and try to debate me on this.
