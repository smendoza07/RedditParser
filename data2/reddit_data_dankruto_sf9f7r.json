That is why Sasuke told Naruto that he will now match Naruto's chakra levels with his EMS in the war.\nYou can argue that this special chakra was always present in dormant form unlocked only by opening of Sharingan.

It was always there. \n\nIt\u2019s what\u2019s in their chakra that does it. Like their special genetics make their body produce chakra with different \u201cchemicals\u201d (that\u2019s what normal non-anime stuff would be called) and such. \n\nAnd again, if you needed these special chakra reserves to use it, then a non uchiha using the eye wouldn\u2019t work since they don\u2019t have the chakra. \n\nAnd the sharingan wouldn\u2019t stay a sharingan cause it doesn\u2019t have the chakra supply. \n\nThe Uchiha might use that special chemical to activate it, because if you take the Uchiha eye while sharingan isn\u2019t activated it\u2019s a normal eye. You can\u2019t make the sharingan activate. It needed to be on when it was taken. \n\nBut there is no new reserve that appears out of nowhere.",

The special chakra which is caused by the sudden feeling of loss of a great love, or by despair at who the person has become or something equally terrible. \nSo yes Opening of Sharingan comes with increase in chakra levels of an Uchiha which again increases on sharingan converting to MS and again enhances if evolved to EMS. That is why Sasuke told Naruto that he will now match Naruto's chakra levels with his EMS in the war.\nYou can argue that this special chakra was always present in dormant form unlocked only by opening of Sharingan. But then again it doesn't change the fact that an Uchiha taps into a special chakra reserve surrounding the brain when he/she opens his/her sharingan.",

If it drains your chakra you\u2019re out of chakra. \n\nLikewise if you use all of your chakra, you can\u2019t use the sharingan. \n\nThere is no shelved chakra. It\u2019s not Kurama. \n\nThere\u2019s a special type of chakra in their head that activates it sure. But it\u2019s not like that chakra suddenly starts going to their head and opens a reserve. It was always there. \n\nIt\u2019s what\u2019s in their chakra that does it. Like their special genetics make their body produce chakra with different \u201cchemicals\u201d (that\u2019s what normal non-anime stuff would be called) and such. \n\nAnd again, if you needed these special chakra reserves to use it, then a non uchiha using the eye wouldn\u2019t work since they don\u2019t have the chakra. \n\nAnd the sharingan wouldn\u2019t stay a sharingan cause it doesn\u2019t have the chakra supply. \n\nThe Uchiha might use that special chemical to activate it, because if you take the Uchiha eye while sharingan isn\u2019t activated it\u2019s a normal eye. You can\u2019t make the sharingan activate. It needed to be on when it was taken. \n\nBut there is no new reserve that appears out of nowhere.",

That is why Sasuke told Naruto that he will now match Naruto's chakra levels with his EMS in the war.\nYou can argue that this special chakra was always present in dormant form unlocked only by opening of Sharingan.

It\u2019s not a reserve.\n\nLike there\u2019s no reserve just for the sharingan. If it drains your chakra you\u2019re out of chakra. \n\nLikewise if you use all of your chakra, you can\u2019t use the sharingan. \n\nThere is no shelved chakra. It\u2019s not Kurama. \n\nThere\u2019s a special type of chakra in their head that activates it sure. But it\u2019s not like that chakra suddenly starts going to their head and opens a reserve. It was always there. \n\nIt\u2019s what\u2019s in their chakra that does it. Like their special genetics make their body produce chakra with different \u201cchemicals\u201d (that\u2019s what normal non-anime stuff would be called) and such. \n\nAnd again, if you needed these special chakra reserves to use it, then a non uchiha using the eye wouldn\u2019t work since they don\u2019t have the chakra. \n\nAnd the sharingan wouldn\u2019t stay a sharingan cause it doesn\u2019t have the chakra supply. \n\nThe Uchiha might use that special chemical to activate it, because if you take the Uchiha eye while sharingan isn\u2019t activated it\u2019s a normal eye. You can\u2019t make the sharingan activate. It needed to be on when it was taken. \n\nBut there is no new reserve that appears out of nowhere.",

That is why Sasuke told Naruto that he will now match Naruto's chakra levels with his EMS in the war.\nYou can argue that this special chakra was always present in dormant form unlocked only by opening of Sharingan.

If it drains your chakra you\u2019re out of chakra. \n\nLikewise if you use all of your chakra, you can\u2019t use the sharingan. \n\nThere is no shelved chakra. It\u2019s not Kurama. \n\nThere\u2019s a special type of chakra in their head that activates it sure. But it\u2019s not like that chakra suddenly starts going to their head and opens a reserve. It was always there. \n\nIt\u2019s what\u2019s in their chakra that does it. Like their special genetics make their body produce chakra with different \u201cchemicals\u201d (that\u2019s what normal non-anime stuff would be called) and such. \n\nAnd again, if you needed these special chakra reserves to use it, then a non uchiha using the eye wouldn\u2019t work since they don\u2019t have the chakra. \n\nAnd the sharingan wouldn\u2019t stay a sharingan cause it doesn\u2019t have the chakra supply. \n\nThe Uchiha might use that special chemical to activate it, because if you take the Uchiha eye while sharingan isn\u2019t activated it\u2019s a normal eye. You can\u2019t make the sharingan activate. It needed to be on when it was taken. \n\nBut there is no new reserve that appears out of nowhere.",

The special chakra which is caused by the sudden feeling of loss of a great love, or by despair at who the person has become or something equally terrible. \nSo yes Opening of Sharingan comes with increase in chakra levels of an Uchiha which again increases on sharingan converting to MS and again enhances if evolved to EMS. That is why Sasuke told Naruto that he will now match Naruto's chakra levels with his EMS in the war.\nYou can argue that this special chakra was always present in dormant form unlocked only by opening of Sharingan. But then again it doesn't change the fact that an Uchiha taps into a special chakra reserve surrounding the brain when he/she opens his/her sharingan.",

If it drains your chakra you\u2019re out of chakra. \n\nLikewise if you use all of your chakra, you can\u2019t use the sharingan. \n\nThere is no shelved chakra. It\u2019s not Kurama. \n\nThere\u2019s a special type of chakra in their head that activates it sure. But it\u2019s not like that chakra suddenly starts going to their head and opens a reserve. It was always there. \n\nIt\u2019s what\u2019s in their chakra that does it. Like their special genetics make their body produce chakra with different \u201cchemicals\u201d (that\u2019s what normal non-anime stuff would be called) and such. \n\nAnd again, if you needed these special chakra reserves to use it, then a non uchiha using the eye wouldn\u2019t work since they don\u2019t have the chakra. \n\nAnd the sharingan wouldn\u2019t stay a sharingan cause it doesn\u2019t have the chakra supply. \n\nThe Uchiha might use that special chemical to activate it, because if you take the Uchiha eye while sharingan isn\u2019t activated it\u2019s a normal eye. You can\u2019t make the sharingan activate. It needed to be on when it was taken. \n\nBut there is no new reserve that appears out of nowhere.",
