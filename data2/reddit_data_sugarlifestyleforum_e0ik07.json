    "body": "Just finished our first 3-day Vacation(a 20 days wait after meet and greet) which was nothing but perfect. \n\nThere was so many ways it could have gone wrong but everything was just the right amount of perfection. He was all the reasons I wanted a SR. I am so grateful that our paths crossed.\n\nI was so out of the place(Lol I thought doorman was someone I know because he opened the cab door and offered to take bags\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23). It was 5 star luxury hotel. I couldn\u2019t stop blushing lol I was just an awkward potato. And he was so sweet and considerate. \n\nWell it was just perfect. He made a little welcome platter with wine, cheese and olives. I was showered with gifts and wisdom(he made me see through a issue I was having and helped me to make my decision). I felt I was everything pretty, sexy, funny, cute and was also made fun of my height (what kinda human is he \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f). He was my soul recharger (I am all blushing in a coffee shop and thinking how awesome past days was. \n\nWe have already made plans for next two months. I am glad I waited for someone worth after my first failed attempt or maybe I just got lucky. \n\nFor all the sugar babies, just don\u2019t let someone treat you like commodity and hold your standard. Don\u2019t treat it as a source of income. Appreciate the good ones in the bowl. \n\nFor all those sugar daddies, the ones who don\u2019t make these relationships transactional. Thank you. You guys are uplifting someone\u2019s quality of life and mental health. \n\nI guess I would like to thank you guys for all the pointers.",
