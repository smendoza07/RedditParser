Remember how many fillers there were?\n\nBut you got a point because kishimoto's style was to add emotions and pain that makes us cry but in case of kodachi, he mainly focuses on giving info and adding to the story and leaves it to the anime to add the sadness but they can not do it like kishi as he is a pro at adding sadness in a crisp and short way that will make us cry.",

But it has to build towards that.\n\nHokage type characters, that our MC looked upto, in Naruto were Hiruzen and Jiraiya, and when the time came they departed whilst doing something important. Same goes with Boruto, except the Hokage type characters are now Sasuke and Naruto, who were previously the MC.\n\nTook 135 eps of fast adoption and 100 eps of fillers for part 1 to wrap up, ie. 220 in total. Same prolly goes with Boruto, we are at 150 approx and it will take around 250 when we will have the timeskip to older Boruto.",

On one side of the spectrum, you have long-time fans that miss the darker, higher-stakes adventures of the original naruto series. On the other side, you have purists that feel like any world-ending threat being applied in boruto would contradict the ending of naruto by making him seem like he failed to keep the leaf in an era of peace.\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget how toxic naruto fans can be. A lot of people say they want real stakes, but would lose their shit if one of their favorite characters was killed off. \n\nThey\u2019re in a Star Wars type situation where it\u2019s literally impossible to keep everyone happy. Personally, I liked the idea of them making a story that takes place multiple generations in the future. However, I think we should all give boruto a chance",

Like for example: The world is in a grave situation where ninjas hate and kill each other. This led Naruto to gain a new perspective and change as a person. Thus, the world building led to Naruto (and by extension the rest of the characters) to have a natural development. From youngsters to learning the truth about the world to saving it.\n\nBoruto however does non of that. It's all just, made up problems in a world that should be near damn perfect. The five hokages are united, Sasuke and Naruto which are two literal demi-gods are leading the peace, yet there are \"problems\" to build the characters. Example: At the beginning of the episode, Boruto hates this classmate of his (that wears a bandanna on his hair), they have a cliche fight then they become cliche friends.\n\nSee the difference? Now compare that to Naruto and Neji's fight. There's just no comparison. One is made out of passion and the other made to milk money out of young audience.",

Boruto could have been better but the ending of Naruto and the lack of emotion hold it back from becoming decent",

But it has to build towards that.\n\nHokage type characters, that our MC looked upto, in Naruto were Hiruzen and Jiraiya, and when the time came they departed whilst doing something important. Same goes with Boruto, except the Hokage type characters are now Sasuke and Naruto, who were previously the MC.\n\nTook 135 eps of fast adoption and 100 eps of fillers for part 1 to wrap up, ie. 220 in total. Same prolly goes with Boruto, we are at 150 approx and it will take around 250 when we will have the timeskip to older Boruto.",

On one side of the spectrum, you have long-time fans that miss the darker, higher-stakes adventures of the original naruto series.

A lot of people say they want real stakes, but would lose their shit if one of their favorite characters was killed off. \n\nThey\u2019re in a Star Wars type situation where it\u2019s literally impossible to keep everyone happy. Personally, I liked the idea of them making a story that takes place multiple generations in the future. However, I think we should all give boruto a chance",

Like for example: The world is in a grave situation where ninjas hate and kill each other. This led Naruto to gain a new perspective and change as a person. Thus, the world building led to Naruto (and by extension the rest of the characters) to have a natural development. From youngsters to learning the truth about the world to saving it.\n\nBoruto however does non of that. It's all just, made up problems in a world that should be near damn perfect. The five hokages are united, Sasuke and Naruto which are two literal demi-gods are leading the peace, yet there are \"problems\" to build the characters. Example: At the beginning of the episode, Boruto hates this classmate of his (that wears a bandanna on his hair), they have a cliche fight then they become cliche friends.\n\nSee the difference? Now compare that to Naruto and Neji's fight. There's just no comparison. One is made out of passion and the other made to milk money out of young audience.",

Boruto could have been better but the ending of Naruto and the lack of emotion hold it back from becoming decent",

Such beautiful animation and colors with unique fight scenes that you could have a painting of it on your wall it looks so cool. Definitely finish it! Slime was kind of just alright but when the protagonist gets to fight some stronger enemies it gets pretty cool and on top of that I think the world seems interesting at the least, I\u2019m looking foward for a season two",

On the other side, you have purists that feel like any world-ending threat being applied in boruto would contradict the ending of naruto by making him seem like he failed to keep the leaf in an era of peace.\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget how toxic naruto fans can be. A lot of people say they want real stakes, but would lose their shit if one of their favorite characters was killed off. \n\nThey\u2019re in a Star Wars type situation where it\u2019s literally impossible to keep everyone happy.

Like for example: The world is in a grave situation where ninjas hate and kill each other. This led Naruto to gain a new perspective and change as a person. Thus, the world building led to Naruto (and by extension the rest of the characters) to have a natural development. From youngsters to learning the truth about the world to saving it.\n\nBoruto however does non of that. It's all just, made up problems in a world that should be near damn perfect. The five hokages are united, Sasuke and Naruto which are two literal demi-gods are leading the peace, yet there are \"problems\" to build the characters. Example: At the beginning of the episode, Boruto hates this classmate of his (that wears a bandanna on his hair), they have a cliche fight then they become cliche friends.\n\nSee the difference? Now compare that to Naruto and Neji's fight. There's just no comparison. One is made out of passion and the other made to milk money out of young audience.",

Boruto could have been better but the ending of Naruto and the lack of emotion hold it back from becoming decent",

Such beautiful animation and colors with unique fight scenes that you could have a painting of it on your wall it looks so cool. Definitely finish it! Slime was kind of just alright but when the protagonist gets to fight some stronger enemies it gets pretty cool and on top of that I think the world seems interesting at the least, I\u2019m looking foward for a season two",

On the other side, you have purists that feel like any world-ending threat being applied in boruto would contradict the ending of naruto by making him seem like he failed to keep the leaf in an era of peace.\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget how toxic naruto fans can be. A lot of people say they want real stakes, but would lose their shit if one of their favorite characters was killed off. \n\nThey\u2019re in a Star Wars type situation where it\u2019s literally impossible to keep everyone happy. Personally, I liked the idea of them making a story that takes place multiple generations in the future. However, I think we should all give boruto a chance",

Boruto could have been better but the ending of Naruto and the lack of emotion hold it back from becoming decent",

A lot of people say they want real stakes, but would lose their shit if one of their favorite characters was killed off. \n\nThey\u2019re in a Star Wars type situation where it\u2019s literally impossible to keep everyone happy.
