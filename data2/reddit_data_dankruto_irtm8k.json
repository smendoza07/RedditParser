Obito obviously loved Rin, Naruto had feelings for Sakura for the longest time, Sakura and Ino were into Sasuke, Hinata was always in love with Naruto.. that\u2019s not to say every 12 year old in the show should like or love someone, but it\u2019s clearly not impossible. I\u2019m not really sure if Rin had romantic feelings for Obito or not. At times it felt like she did, while it really could\u2019ve been her viewing him as a best friend or even brother while she was into Kakashi. And I mean, come on, Kakashi was always a badass, why wouldn\u2019t she be into him? lol",

I\u2019m not really sure if Rin had romantic feelings for Obito or not. At times it felt like she did, while it really could\u2019ve been her viewing him as a best friend or even brother while she was into Kakashi. And I mean, come on, Kakashi was always a badass, why wouldn\u2019t she be into him? lol",

I\u2019m not really sure if Rin had romantic feelings for Obito or not. At times it felt like she did, while it really could\u2019ve been her viewing him as a best friend or even brother while she was into Kakashi.
