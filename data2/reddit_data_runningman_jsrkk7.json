While she sheds tears easily, she quickly covers it up with a smile.\n\nShe reminds of of idol Kim Se Jeong (former IOI, Gugudan) who when asked to write a letter to her 3 year old self, wrote:\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t be scared. Cry, fall, and get hurt. And don\u2019t smile all the time, you dummy. You\u2019re doing a good job.\u201d\n\n[https://www.soompi.com/article/1244955wpp/gugudans-kim-sejeong-pens-emotional-letter-3-year-old-self-open](https://www.soompi.com/article/1244955wpp/gugudans-kim-sejeong-pens-emotional-letter-3-year-old-self-open)",
