Naruto didn't have those moments because most of them came in the war arc right after eachother like a teacher calling role. And most of them were really similar. Loved one dies, world is corrupt, must destroy the leaf. Love orochimaru though since he's just doing it because (here's where a little head canon/theory comes in) hes scared of not knowing, like me. \n\nLove Fairytail, one piece, and Naruto. And bleach. Those are probally my top 4 anime. Naruto was my first anime, then I watched boruto and it made me hate anime (I was very closed minded) then I finally got convinced to watch bleach after my cousins friend showed me a clip of ichigo grabbing aizen by the face then I loved anime again. Watched Fairytail after that with some small anime (episodes wise) then made my way to one piece slowly.",

The expectations for Sakura are higher than they are for characters like Ino and Hinata because she is a main character and the other two are side characters with a fraction of her screen time. Sakura's feats are just really underwhelming when taking into account her massive amount of screen time, her status as a main character and when compared to the other three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Kakashi) instead of side characters with a fraction of her screen time like Hinata and Tenten and her character development wasn't that great imo (although I do think it was better than people give credit for especially the way her relationship with Naruto went from hating him to seeing him as a brother). I had high hopes for her after her fight with Sasori and had she continued down that route I would actually have liked her character a lot. She is quite good in Boruto admittedly but Boruto doesn't quite live up to Naruto. I don't count the light novels because of how often they retcon stuff (like Itachi using Tsukuyomi without making eye contact) and the fact that they're not even written by Kishimoto. I don't care that they're approved by Kishi I still don't count them.",

Sakura's feats are still very underwhelming when compared to the other three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Kakashi). And this is also not exactly true. Tenten, Kiba, Choji, Shizune, Hinata etc are all side characters and yet their feats are also quite underwhelming. People just don't bring it up as often because they aren't expected to have impressive feats due to lack of screen time and their status as side characters. This is also not exclusive to Naruto fans. The fandoms of most franchises out there generally have higher expectations for main characters as opposed to side characters. \n\n>My personal rule is that the novels are canon unless they actively dispute something we already know.

Naruto didn't have those moments because most of them came in the war arc right after eachother like a teacher calling role. And most of them were really similar. Loved one dies, world is corrupt, must destroy the leaf. Love orochimaru though since he's just doing it because (here's where a little head canon/theory comes in) hes scared of not knowing, like me. \n\nLove Fairytail, one piece, and Naruto. And bleach. Those are probally my top 4 anime. Naruto was my first anime, then I watched boruto and it made me hate anime (I was very closed minded) then I finally got convinced to watch bleach after my cousins friend showed me a clip of ichigo grabbing aizen by the face then I loved anime again. Watched Fairytail after that with some small anime (episodes wise) then made my way to one piece slowly.",

The expectations for Sakura are higher than they are for characters like Ino and Hinata because she is a main character and the other two are side characters with a fraction of her screen time. Sakura's feats are just really underwhelming when taking into account her massive amount of screen time, her status as a main character and when compared to the other three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Kakashi) instead of side characters with a fraction of her screen time like Hinata and Tenten and her character development wasn't that great imo (although I do think it was better than people give credit for especially the way her relationship with Naruto went from hating him to seeing him as a brother). I had high hopes for her after her fight with Sasori and had she continued down that route I would actually have liked her character a lot. She is quite good in Boruto admittedly but Boruto doesn't quite live up to Naruto. I don't count the light novels because of how often they retcon stuff (like Itachi using Tsukuyomi without making eye contact) and the fact that they're not even written by Kishimoto.

Sakura will be in most moments regardless of whether kishi planned to use her cuz she's on the same squad as naruto. \n\nI don't really think it's a weak argument. Sakura's feats are still very underwhelming when compared to the other three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Kakashi). And this is also not exactly true. Tenten, Kiba, Choji, Shizune, Hinata etc are all side characters and yet their feats are also quite underwhelming. People just don't bring it up as often because they aren't expected to have impressive feats due to lack of screen time and their status as side characters. This is also not exclusive to Naruto fans. The fandoms of most franchises out there generally have higher expectations for main characters as opposed to side characters. \n\n>My personal rule is that the novels are canon unless they actively dispute something we already know.

You know that applies to every fictional character, right?\n\nYeah but with Sakura is super obvious. She was supposed to be a good, well liked character but she isn't so it's bad writing. \n\n\nSomeone like danzo is also hated, but he was *supposed* to be hated so it's not \"bad writing\".\n\n>I don't really think it's a weak argument. Sakura's feats are still very underwhelming when compared to the other three main characters\n\nI'm not saying they're not. My point is that her feats are underwhelming because kishi can't write women, not because of her. I know you can technically say that for everyone, but in sakuras case it's just so painfully obvious it's a writing issue",

Naruto didn't have those moments because most of them came in the war arc right after eachother like a teacher calling role. And most of them were really similar. Loved one dies, world is corrupt, must destroy the leaf. Love orochimaru though since he's just doing it because (here's where a little head canon/theory comes in) hes scared of not knowing, like me. \n\nLove Fairytail, one piece, and Naruto. And bleach. Those are probally my top 4 anime. Naruto was my first anime, then I watched boruto and it made me hate anime (I was very closed minded) then I finally got convinced to watch bleach after my cousins friend showed me a clip of ichigo grabbing aizen by the face then I loved anime again. Watched Fairytail after that with some small anime (episodes wise) then made my way to one piece slowly.",

The expectations for Sakura are higher than they are for characters like Ino and Hinata because she is a main character and the other two are side characters with a fraction of her screen time. Sakura's feats are just really underwhelming when taking into account her massive amount of screen time, her status as a main character and when compared to the other three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Kakashi) instead of side characters with a fraction of her screen time like Hinata and Tenten and her character development wasn't that great imo (although I do think it was better than people give credit for especially the way her relationship with Naruto went from hating him to seeing him as a brother). I had high hopes for her after her fight with Sasori and had she continued down that route I would actually have liked her character a lot. She is quite good in Boruto admittedly but Boruto doesn't quite live up to Naruto. I don't count the light novels because of how often they retcon stuff (like Itachi using Tsukuyomi without making eye contact) and the fact that they're not even written by Kishimoto. I don't care that they're approved by Kishi I still don't count them.",

I literally stated that the opinion of the fandom is mostly based on her screentime and status as a main character and that most of the female cast is badly written (some exceptions like Tsunade exist). \n\n>It's not an issue with the character, it's an issue with kishimoto.\n\n>And again, the issues with her character here are more on kishimoto \n\nI don't know why Sakura fans always use this argument.

Sakura will be in most moments regardless of whether kishi planned to use her cuz she's on the same squad as naruto. \n\nI don't really think it's a weak argument. Sakura's feats are still very underwhelming when compared to the other three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Kakashi). And this is also not exactly true. Tenten, Kiba, Choji, Shizune, Hinata etc are all side characters and yet their feats are also quite underwhelming. People just don't bring it up as often because they aren't expected to have impressive feats due to lack of screen time and their status as side characters. This is also not exclusive to Naruto fans. The fandoms of most franchises out there generally have higher expectations for main characters as opposed to side characters. \n\n>My personal rule is that the novels are canon unless they actively dispute something we already know. In that case, I just consider that specific moment filler and not the novel as a whole. I do see where you're coming from though.\n\nIt was just one example. The novels are filled with such retcons that contradict the manga.",

You know that applies to every fictional character, right?\n\nYeah but with Sakura is super obvious. She was supposed to be a good, well liked character but she isn't so it's bad writing. \n\n\nSomeone like danzo is also hated, but he was *supposed* to be hated so it's not \"bad writing\".\n\n>I don't really think it's a weak argument.

My point is that her feats are underwhelming because kishi can't write women, not because of her. I know you can technically say that for everyone, but in sakuras case it's just so painfully obvious it's a writing issue",

Naruto didn't have those moments because most of them came in the war arc right after eachother like a teacher calling role. And most of them were really similar. Loved one dies, world is corrupt, must destroy the leaf. Love orochimaru though since he's just doing it because (here's where a little head canon/theory comes in) hes scared of not knowing, like me. \n\nLove Fairytail, one piece, and Naruto. And bleach. Those are probally my top 4 anime. Naruto was my first anime, then I watched boruto and it made me hate anime (I was very closed minded) then I finally got convinced to watch bleach after my cousins friend showed me a clip of ichigo grabbing aizen by the face then I loved anime again. Watched Fairytail after that with some small anime (episodes wise) then made my way to one piece slowly.",

The expectations for Sakura are higher than they are for characters like Ino and Hinata because she is a main character and the other two are side characters with a fraction of her screen time.

I had high hopes for her after her fight with Sasori and had she continued down that route I would actually have liked her character a lot. She is quite good in Boruto admittedly but Boruto doesn't quite live up to Naruto. I don't count the light novels because of how often they retcon stuff (like Itachi using Tsukuyomi without making eye contact) and the fact that they're not even written by Kishimoto.

The expectations for Sakura are higher than they are for characters like Ino and Hinata because she is a main character and the other two are side characters with a fraction of her screen time. Sakura's feats are just really underwhelming when taking into account her massive amount of screen time, her status as a main character and when compared to the other three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Kakashi) instead of side characters with a fraction of her screen time like Hinata and Tenten and her character development wasn't that great imo (although I do think it was better than people give credit for especially the way her relationship with Naruto went from hating him to seeing him as a brother). I had high hopes for her after her fight with Sasori and had she continued down that route I would actually have liked her character a lot. She is quite good in Boruto admittedly but Boruto doesn't quite live up to Naruto. I don't count the light novels because of how often they retcon stuff (like Itachi using Tsukuyomi without making eye contact) and the fact that they're not even written by Kishimoto. I don't care that they're approved by Kishi I still don't count them.",

Sakura's feats are still very underwhelming when compared to the other three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Kakashi). And this is also not exactly true. Tenten, Kiba, Choji, Shizune, Hinata etc are all side characters and yet their feats are also quite underwhelming. People just don't bring it up as often because they aren't expected to have impressive feats due to lack of screen time and their status as side characters. This is also not exclusive to Naruto fans. The fandoms of most franchises out there generally have higher expectations for main characters as opposed to side characters. \n\n>My personal rule is that the novels are canon unless they actively dispute something we already know. In that case, I just consider that specific moment filler and not the novel as a whole. I do see where you're coming from though.\n\nIt was just one example.

You know that applies to every fictional character, right?\n\nYeah but with Sakura is super obvious. She was supposed to be a good, well liked character but she isn't so it's bad writing. \n\n\nSomeone like danzo is also hated, but he was *supposed* to be hated so it's not \"bad writing\".\n\n>I don't really think it's a weak argument. Sakura's feats are still very underwhelming when compared to the other three main characters\n\nI'm not saying they're not. My point is that her feats are underwhelming because kishi can't write women, not because of her. I know you can technically say that for everyone, but in sakuras case it's just so painfully obvious it's a writing issue",

The expectations for Sakura are higher than they are for characters like Ino and Hinata because she is a main character and the other two are side characters with a fraction of her screen time. Sakura's feats are just really underwhelming when taking into account her massive amount of screen time, her status as a main character and when compared to the other three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Kakashi) instead of side characters with a fraction of her screen time like Hinata and Tenten and her character development wasn't that great imo (although I do think it was better than people give credit for especially the way her relationship with Naruto went from hating him to seeing him as a brother). I had high hopes for her after her fight with Sasori and had she continued down that route I would actually have liked her character a lot. She is quite good in Boruto admittedly but Boruto doesn't quite live up to Naruto. I don't count the light novels because of how often they retcon stuff (like Itachi using Tsukuyomi without making eye contact) and the fact that they're not even written by Kishimoto. I don't care that they're approved by Kishi I still don't count them.",

If you replace Sakura with someone like Hinata or ino, they would be just as useless and underwhelming. It's not an issue with the character, it's an issue with kishimoto. Her status as a main character doesn't really matter that much. \n\n\nYou can say that *proportionally* the side characters do more, but imo that's a pretty weak argument since side characters are generally only ever shown when they're meant to do something. Sakura will be in most moments regardless of whether kishi planned to use her cuz she's on the same squad as naruto. And again, the issues with her character here are more on kishimoto, rather than the character itself. She has potential as a character, he just never really expands on it much. \n\n>I don't count the light novels because of how much they retcon stuff\n\nMy personal rule is that the novels are canon unless they actively dispute something we already know.

If you replace Sakura with someone like Hinata or ino, they would be just as useless and underwhelming.\n\nI never stated otherwise. I literally stated that the opinion of the fandom is mostly based on her screentime and status as a main character and that most of the female cast is badly written (some exceptions like Tsunade exist). \n\n>It's not an issue with the character, it's an issue with kishimoto.\n\n>And again, the issues with her character here are more on kishimoto \n\nI don't know why Sakura fans always use this argument. You know that applies to every fictional character, right?\n\n>You can say that proportionally the side characters do more, but imo that's a pretty weak argument since side characters are generally only ever shown when they're meant to do something. Sakura will be in most moments regardless of whether kishi planned to use her cuz she's on the same squad as naruto. \n\nI don't really think it's a weak argument. Sakura's feats are still very underwhelming when compared to the other three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Kakashi). And this is also not exactly true. Tenten, Kiba, Choji, Shizune, Hinata etc are all side characters and yet their feats are also quite underwhelming. People just don't bring it up as often because they aren't expected to have impressive feats due to lack of screen time and their status as side characters. This is also not exclusive to Naruto fans. The fandoms of most franchises out there generally have higher expectations for main characters as opposed to side characters. \n\n>My personal rule is that the novels are canon unless they actively dispute something we already know. In that case, I just consider that specific moment filler and not the novel as a whole. I do see where you're coming from though.\n\nIt was just one example. The novels are filled with such retcons that contradict the manga.",

You know that applies to every fictional character, right?\n\nYeah but with Sakura is super obvious. She was supposed to be a good, well liked character but she isn't so it's bad writing. \n\n\nSomeone like danzo is also hated, but he was *supposed* to be hated so it's not \"bad writing\".\n\n>I don't really think it's a weak argument. Sakura's feats are still very underwhelming when compared to the other three main characters\n\nI'm not saying they're not. My point is that her feats are underwhelming because kishi can't write women, not because of her. I know you can technically say that for everyone, but in sakuras case it's just so painfully obvious it's a writing issue",

I literally stated that the opinion of the fandom is mostly based on her screentime and status as a main character and that most of the female cast is badly written (some exceptions like Tsunade exist). \n\n>It's not an issue with the character, it's an issue with kishimoto.\n\n>And again, the issues with her character here are more on kishimoto \n\nI don't know why Sakura fans always use this argument.

Sakura will be in most moments regardless of whether kishi planned to use her cuz she's on the same squad as naruto. \n\nI don't really think it's a weak argument. Sakura's feats are still very underwhelming when compared to the other three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Kakashi). And this is also not exactly true. Tenten, Kiba, Choji, Shizune, Hinata etc are all side characters and yet their feats are also quite underwhelming. People just don't bring it up as often because they aren't expected to have impressive feats due to lack of screen time and their status as side characters. This is also not exclusive to Naruto fans. The fandoms of most franchises out there generally have higher expectations for main characters as opposed to side characters. \n\n>My personal rule is that the novels are canon unless they actively dispute something we already know. In that case, I just consider that specific moment filler and not the novel as a whole. I do see where you're coming from though.\n\nIt was just one example. The novels are filled with such retcons that contradict the manga.",

She was supposed to be a good, well liked character but she isn't so it's bad writing. \n\n\nSomeone like danzo is also hated, but he was *supposed* to be hated so it's not \"bad writing\".\n\n>I don't really think it's a weak argument. Sakura's feats are still very underwhelming when compared to the other three main characters\n\nI'm not saying they're not. My point is that her feats are underwhelming because kishi can't write women, not because of her. I know you can technically say that for everyone, but in sakuras case it's just so painfully obvious it's a writing issue",

She was supposed to be a good, well liked character but she isn't so it's bad writing. \n\n\nSomeone like danzo is also hated, but he was *supposed* to be hated so it's not \"bad writing\".\n\n>I don't really think it's a weak argument.

My point is that her feats are underwhelming because kishi can't write women, not because of her. I know you can technically say that for everyone, but in sakuras case it's just so painfully obvious it's a writing issue",

I had high hopes for her after her fight with Sasori and had she continued down that route I would actually have liked her character a lot. She is quite good in Boruto admittedly but Boruto doesn't quite live up to Naruto.

You know that applies to every fictional character, right?\n\n>You can say that proportionally the side characters do more, but imo that's a pretty weak argument since side characters are generally only ever shown when they're meant to do something. Sakura will be in most moments regardless of whether kishi planned to use her cuz she's on the same squad as naruto. \n\nI don't really think it's a weak argument. Sakura's feats are still very underwhelming when compared to the other three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Kakashi). And this is also not exactly true. Tenten, Kiba, Choji, Shizune, Hinata etc are all side characters and yet their feats are also quite underwhelming. People just don't bring it up as often because they aren't expected to have impressive feats due to lack of screen time and their status as side characters. This is also not exclusive to Naruto fans. The fandoms of most franchises out there generally have higher expectations for main characters as opposed to side characters. \n\n>My personal rule is that the novels are canon unless they actively dispute something we already know. In that case, I just consider that specific moment filler and not the novel as a whole. I do see where you're coming from though.\n\nIt was just one example. The novels are filled with such retcons that contradict the manga.",

My point is that her feats are underwhelming because kishi can't write women, not because of her. I know you can technically say that for everyone, but in sakuras case it's just so painfully obvious it's a writing issue",
