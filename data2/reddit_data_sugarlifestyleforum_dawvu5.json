    "body": "I joined SA for the first time pretty sure I knew what I was getting into. I\u2019d had not exactly an arrangement so much as a spoiled-fwb during college. \n\nI thought meeting someone through the site would be sexy, fun, and get me a little extra money. \n\nAfter a few M&Gs I met my currant SD and he is most definitely sexy, fun, and generous but he is also the most encouraging person! \n\nHe is always asking about my goals and giving me the boost of confidence I need to see them through. When he asks me what I am going to do with upcoming vacation time it makes me realize that a lazy Netflix and chips extravaganza is really not all I want to accomplish- I want to take a class, climb a mountain, brush up my resume and apply for the job I\u2019ve been dreaming about!\n\nMy SD makes me feel like I can take on the world. It\u2019s so much better than what I was looking for.",
