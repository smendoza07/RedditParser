    "body": "Ladies and gentleman for fucks sake wash your asshole! \n\nMet a new SD, things went well so we moved on to his place. I went downtown on him but immediately caught a whiff of shit! I popped my head up and said \u201cdid you wash your ass??\u201d\nSD: \u201cUhhhh\u201d \nMe: *Stands up and points to the bathroom* \u201cGo wash your ass right now!\u201d \nSD scurries to the bathroom instantly. \n\nBefore you say it - yeah I know that wasn\u2019t a pleasant way of putting it but neither is smelling shit. I\u2019m also a Dominatrix so the men I go for like when I\u2019m rather forceful and demanding with them. Most of you have been on this planet longer than I\u2019ve been alive so you should know by now that your butthole smells like poop and you need to use soap on it, like dear lord. \n\nLadies say something please! Otherwise they\u2019re going to think nothing is wrong and pass the problem on to the next person. You don\u2019t have to do it like it did but I did get results. And to the next woman who gets this SD when I break up with him, you\u2019re welcome. \n\nHave a nice day everyone. Love you \ud83d\ude18",

It\u2019s rather ridiculous/humorous to some and 2. I actually said something. I corrected a behavior that most people would not. I like whipping men into shape, it\u2019s my thing and I know the next woman will be thankful for me.\n\nAnyway, my previous SD and I had a really great relationship but we ended things and moved towards friendship. We still talk, hangout, and lean on each other to this days. When I met him, he was still in the process of healing from his divorce and wandering around in the dark with a blindfold on. I was light years ahead of him in regards to healing and I saw him stumbling about, I could see that he was a new sugar daddy as well so I snatched that sweet man up showed him the way out. We would talk for hours about anything and everything, and I even taught him what I knew about polyamory as he was very interested in having a relationships like that. He said to me once \u201cMy life is much better with you in it. You\u2019ve helped heal me and honestly I think you\u2019ve healed a lot of men without them realizing it. I will be forever grateful for everything you\u2019ve done for me.\u201d I\u2019m so fucking happy for him and proud of him but a little worried- he had been talking to this girl for a few weeks and they went on one date. He called told me afterwards that he could see himself marrying this girl lol. I\u2019m happy I opened his heart up to love again but yeah, I think he needs to tighten the reigns on his heart just a little bit.",

As a career wildland firefighter, believe me when I tell you I know what it means to get filthy dirty. Maintaining ones personal hygiene can be difficult, and is sometimes pretty low on the priority list (behind food and sleep) when one is out on the lines for weeks at a time. But even we are smart enough to take advantage of those shower trailers in camp for a thorough scrub down (you wouldn't believe where ash and dirt, and leaves and sawdust can accumulate on the human body!). We're not 'effing animals! I'm probably hyper sensitive to my own hygiene when prepping for a date. I would be mortified if my SB was put off even in the slightest by any aspect of my personal hygiene. As just a bit of evidence... I have to drive 2.5 hrs one way to see my babes. I shower, along with all the other prep steps, before I leave of course. And immediately shower again upon arrival at the hotel, to refresh everything that might have gotten hot and sweaty during the drive. I don't want her to be hesitant to explore wherever her desires might take her because she's afraid of what she might find or smell. Dingle berries!! Really!?!  Wouldn't a guy want to be absolutely as physically desirable as possible when getting naked with his date, no matter the context?",

We talked about lives, family, work, his divorce, my dating history, interests and got to know each other from a distance because, well, it\u2019s a long distance relationship. I don\u2019t just pick a man and go home with him (did you read the part about going back to his place and not a hotel or no?) And yeah we slept together the first time we got together because we\u2019re long distance and won\u2019t see each other again for a while. Surprise! \n\nNow go do something better with your time darling. You could die tomorrow so stop trolling Reddit posts lol.",

Anyone who ever suffered from episodes of bad food decisions and the toll on the butthole could appreciate how this would lessen the suffering. \n\nI am very sensitive to smells. Like in my house the only ones who have a better nose are my dogs because I'm usually trying to find what and where an unusual smell comes from while my wife and daughter never smell crap it seems. Frustrating. My point is that I totally feel bad for some of you women out there who encounter those men with poor hygiene or bad breath. I'm in my 40s and until I joined seeking reading profiles mentioning good hygiene specifically mentioned I only thought this would be an issue in young boys and very old men.  A girl can be a 9-10 and if her breath is bad I am going to puke. I remember in high school there was a girl I thought was very cute then I asked her to dance and we began talking and I don't care how much I loved her British accent I would not be dancing long with her.",

This is the same guy who admitted me to that he was so bad about cutting his toe nails that he needed to see a doctor to get an ingrown nail removed. I thought that was questionable but I didn\u2019t think I would dealing a dank butthole as well. This is a very generous answer you\u2019ve provided and I love that you think positively but sometimes people are indeed poop monsters. I\u2019ve heard a few men refer to their testicles as mudflaps (they wipe back to front. If I hear a man say that about their boys I\u2019m out). Do I think it was intentional? No but it\u2019s rather astounding how many people don\u2019t think about basic things like to wash in between their cheeks, use a nail brush to get the dirt out from under their nails or to wash their hands/brush the teeth before touching/putting their mouth on someone\u2019s genitalia. \n\nI am a Dominatrix and he knew that about me when we started talking (which is one reason why he liked me to begin with. He\u2019s a sub). So my aggressive approach was to be expected. If I don\u2019t like something, I let it be known and I\u2019m not going to be sweet about it either. I\u2019m not a gentle Domme and I won\u2019t put up with anyone\u2019s shit. I know that\u2019s off putting to some people but we agreed that I could talk him like he\u2019s an idiot so long as I refrain from using words that trigger or hurt him which I did. \n\nNow if he did get an upset stomach, I would have apologized and assured him it was ok to speak up and tell me if he\u2019s not feeling well and needs to put things on pause (I\u2019m not that cruel) but I don\u2019t think that was the case. Having a boner doesn\u2019t excuse you from using safe words or stopping things when you don\u2019t feel well.",

It\u2019s rather ridiculous/humorous to some and 2. I actually said something. I corrected a behavior that most people would not. I like whipping men into shape, it\u2019s my thing and I know the next woman will be thankful for me.\n\nAnyway, my previous SD and I had a really great relationship but we ended things and moved towards friendship. We still talk, hangout, and lean on each other to this days. When I met him, he was still in the process of healing from his divorce and wandering around in the dark with a blindfold on. I was light years ahead of him in regards to healing and I saw him stumbling about, I could see that he was a new sugar daddy as well so I snatched that sweet man up showed him the way out. We would talk for hours about anything and everything, and I even taught him what I knew about polyamory as he was very interested in having a relationships like that. He said to me once \u201cMy life is much better with you in it. You\u2019ve helped heal me and honestly I think you\u2019ve healed a lot of men without them realizing it. I will be forever grateful for everything you\u2019ve done for me.\u201d I\u2019m so fucking happy for him and proud of him but a little worried- he had been talking to this girl for a few weeks and they went on one date. He called told me afterwards that he could see himself marrying this girl lol. I\u2019m happy I opened his heart up to love again but yeah, I think he needs to tighten the reigns on his heart just a little bit.",

This is the same guy who admitted me to that he was so bad about cutting his toe nails that he needed to see a doctor to get an ingrown nail removed. I thought that was questionable but I didn\u2019t think I would dealing a dank butthole as well. This is a very generous answer you\u2019ve provided and I love that you think positively but sometimes people are indeed poop monsters. I\u2019ve heard a few men refer to their testicles as mudflaps (they wipe back to front. If I hear a man say that about their boys I\u2019m out). Do I think it was intentional? No but it\u2019s rather astounding how many people don\u2019t think about basic things like to wash in between their cheeks, use a nail brush to get the dirt out from under their nails or to wash their hands/brush the teeth before touching/putting their mouth on someone\u2019s genitalia. \n\nI am a Dominatrix and he knew that about me when we started talking (which is one reason why he liked me to begin with. He\u2019s a sub). So my aggressive approach was to be expected. If I don\u2019t like something, I let it be known and I\u2019m not going to be sweet about it either. I\u2019m not a gentle Domme and I won\u2019t put up with anyone\u2019s shit. I know that\u2019s off putting to some people but we agreed that I could talk him like he\u2019s an idiot so long as I refrain from using words that trigger or hurt him which I did. \n\nNow if he did get an upset stomach, I would have apologized and assured him it was ok to speak up and tell me if he\u2019s not feeling well and needs to put things on pause (I\u2019m not that cruel) but I don\u2019t think that was the case.

We talked about lives, family, work, his divorce, my dating history, interests and got to know each other from a distance because, well, it\u2019s a long distance relationship. I don\u2019t just pick a man and go home with him (did you read the part about going back to his place and not a hotel or no?) And yeah we slept together the first time we got together because we\u2019re long distance and won\u2019t see each other again for a while. Surprise! \n\nNow go do something better with your time darling. You could die tomorrow so stop trolling Reddit posts lol.",
