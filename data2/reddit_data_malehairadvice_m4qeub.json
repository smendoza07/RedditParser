Not hundred percent sure about the skull shape/size thing but it's one of the reasons the two block cut(Korean cut for some) which is similar to an undercut has the undercut cut a little lower at the sides. It gives dimension and shape to a smaller head if I'm not wrong but I'm no professional.\n\nApparently Asians have thicker hair strands but also lesser hair per inch or something. This also means stiffer hair in general. Thus some waxes that may work on softer European hair may not work on some Asians. But the term Asian is a super broad term so this may not apply to every Asian race. Some Asians have really curly hair and some have really straight stuff hair. So it really depends in the end. There's too many cultures and races to consider. I've only read about Korean and Japanese cuts so that's where my knowledge ends. \n\nAgain not a professional so take this with a pinch of salt.\n\nEdit. Also \"Europeans\" are a large bunch of people with different cultures and races. There could also be Europeans with thicker hair than asians per strand I'm not super sure on everything.",

Not hundred percent sure about the skull shape/size thing but it's one of the reasons the two block cut(Korean cut for some) which is similar to an undercut has the undercut cut a little lower at the sides. It gives dimension and shape to a smaller head if I'm not wrong but I'm no professional.\n\nApparently Asians have thicker hair strands but also lesser hair per inch or something. This also means stiffer hair in general. Thus some waxes that may work on softer European hair may not work on some Asians. But the term Asian is a super broad term so this may not apply to every Asian race. Some Asians have really curly hair and some have really straight stuff hair. So it really depends in the end. There's too many cultures and races to consider. I've only read about Korean and Japanese cuts so that's where my knowledge ends. \n\nAgain not a professional so take this with a pinch of salt.\n\nEdit. Also \"Europeans\" are a large bunch of people with different cultures and races. There could also be Europeans with thicker hair than asians per strand I'm not super sure on everything.",

Not hundred percent sure about the skull shape/size thing but it's one of the reasons the two block cut(Korean cut for some) which is similar to an undercut has the undercut cut a little lower at the sides. It gives dimension and shape to a smaller head if I'm not wrong but I'm no professional.\n\nApparently Asians have thicker hair strands but also lesser hair per inch or something. This also means stiffer hair in general. Thus some waxes that may work on softer European hair may not work on some Asians. But the term Asian is a super broad term so this may not apply to every Asian race. Some Asians have really curly hair and some have really straight stuff hair. So it really depends in the end. There's too many cultures and races to consider. I've only read about Korean and Japanese cuts so that's where my knowledge ends. \n\nAgain not a professional so take this with a pinch of salt.\n\nEdit. Also \"Europeans\" are a large bunch of people with different cultures and races. There could also be Europeans with thicker hair than asians per strand I'm not super sure on everything.",
