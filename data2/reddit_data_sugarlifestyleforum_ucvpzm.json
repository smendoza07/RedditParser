For one, these are all undocumented stories. You have no idea is someone, or some group has an agenda against the lifestyle or even against a particular SD. So unless we start to see lots of news reports from the media i would not say that Sugar dating has an issue any greater then dating in general.",

It\u2019s clear so it can be quickly dropped into someone\u2019s drink, and it has only a slight, faint taste, so it\u2019s almost impossible to taste. I\u2019ve heard of it being injected into candies like cordial cherries before, but never a mint like was described here (I\u2019m not even sure how a mint could absorb that much GHB, nor have I ever heard of it being delivered that way before, which was the source of my original question to the OP about it). It\u2019s fairly easy to obtain on the street and it\u2019s not expensive (in liquid form), so it\u2019s by far the most commonly used \u201cdate rape\u201d drug. \n\nRohypnol and Ketamine are out there as well, but those are practically impossible to deliver surreptitiously. Those are usually found at parties rather than some random person trying to slip a date something to knock them out.",

It\u2019s clear so it can be quickly dropped into someone\u2019s drink, and it has only a slight, faint taste, so it\u2019s almost impossible to taste. I\u2019ve heard of it being injected into candies like cordial cherries before, but never a mint like was described here (I\u2019m not even sure how a mint could absorb that much GHB, nor have I ever heard of it being delivered that way before, which was the source of my original question to the OP about it). It\u2019s fairly easy to obtain on the street and it\u2019s not expensive (in liquid form), so it\u2019s by far the most commonly used \u201cdate rape\u201d drug. \n\nRohypnol and Ketamine are out there as well, but those are practically impossible to deliver surreptitiously. Those are usually found at parties rather than some random person trying to slip a date something to knock them out.",

It\u2019s clear so it can be quickly dropped into someone\u2019s drink, and it has only a slight, faint taste, so it\u2019s almost impossible to taste. I\u2019ve heard of it being injected into candies like cordial cherries before, but never a mint like was described here (I\u2019m not even sure how a mint could absorb that much GHB, nor have I ever heard of it being delivered that way before, which was the source of my original question to the OP about it). It\u2019s fairly easy to obtain on the street and it\u2019s not expensive (in liquid form), so it\u2019s by far the most commonly used \u201cdate rape\u201d drug. \n\nRohypnol and Ketamine are out there as well, but those are practically impossible to deliver surreptitiously. Those are usually found at parties rather than some random person trying to slip a date something to knock them out.",
