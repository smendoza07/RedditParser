    "body": "I am just happy!\n\nYes, I had all the issues we talk and complain about: Obvious scammers, fakes, platonics, entitled, people who ghost. Still, I was on Seeking for only 2+ weeks this time around. I had my screening down, had m&g with 5 girls who showed up. With 3 of them I really had a good time, alignment of expectations, and a gut feeling to be comfortable starting an arrangement with.\n\nBut there was this one young woman. I actually met her a few years ago on Seeking Arrangements, we went on a few (platonic) dates then, but we never started an arrangement and we lost sight of each other. Low and behold, we reconnected via the website, had flirty banter via text, met for drinks. It was extremely easy to agree on the important stuff, and there you have it. First full date went even better than I could hope for, I am excited and happy like a teenager.\n\nWish us luck that this continues for the longer run!",
