    "body": "I had an interview this week for my dream co-op job, and I absolutely crushed it thanks to my SD! \n\nAll my past interviews were in the restaurant industry where I was basically just looked up and down and asked what my availability was. So last week, after I arranged my first interview in the field I\u2019m studying, I realized I hadn\u2019t yet experienced a true interview. \n\nMy SD spent over an hour giving tips and coaching me, and they were so helpful despite us being in completely different fields. \n\nI received the offer for the position this morning!\nI\u2019ll definitely be showing my SD gratitude for his help next time I see him \ud83d\ude09",

I spoke to PlayfulMentor for a bit and it was so great just hashing out what I\u2019d like to do next. Surprisingly the most helpful part was getting asked questions I hadn\u2019t really thought about but that I do need to nail down to move forward. So even if you\u2019re not sure exactly what you want to do (maybe tech, maybe you\u2019re still figuring out your interests or if you should go back to school, etc.), take the opportunity to chat with someone who\u2019s established and at a point in their career where we likely all hope to be one day.",

I personally interviewed the first 500. \n\nAt many companies, there are 2 \"screens\" you need to get through. One is a \"skills screen.\" We are trying to find out do you have the right skills to do the job? These could be very specific skills, like a programming language, carpentry, plumbing, etc.\n\nThe other is a \"behavioral screen.\" We are trying to figure out do you have the right personality, the right mindset for the job. For instance, the job might require a very high degree of teamwork.  We need to figure out if you can actually work effectively in a team. You may have amazing skills, but if you can't work in a team, then your skills don't matter. \n\nThe most common approach to the \"behavioral screen\" is to do somthing called a behavioral interview. In a behavioral interview, we tende to ask questions that start with \"Tell me about a time when...\" We are trying to understand past behavior, because while it is imperfect, it is the best indicator we have of future performance. Here is a typical example of a BI question on teamwork: \"Share an example of how you were able to motivate a coworker, your peers or your team.\"\n\nThere is a great deal of informaton on behavioral interviewing on-online. Here is a link to get you started from Indeed.\n\n[https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/most-common-behavioral-interview-questions-and-answers](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/most-common-behavioral-interview-questions-and-answers)\n\nTo bring this full circle, at my last company, we STARTED with a behavioral screen. Why? I can teach you skills like how to use Excel. It is WAY harder to teach you new behaviors. If you didn't come to the company with the right behaviors, no level of right skills mattered.",

Well done to both of you, and congratulations!\n\nEdit: reading the rest of the thread I see I'm not the only techie that made this offer! Elated to see that, as I thought, the tech field is genuinely helpful to newbies and SDs care about helping young women succeed, even if they are not in a relationship. SLF rocks!",

Surprisingly the most helpful part was getting asked questions I hadn\u2019t really thought about but that I do need to nail down to move forward. So even if you\u2019re not sure exactly what you want to do (maybe tech, maybe you\u2019re still figuring out your interests or if you should go back to school, etc.), take the opportunity to chat with someone who\u2019s established and at a point in their career where we likely all hope to be one day.",

I personally interviewed the first 500. \n\nAt many companies, there are 2 \"screens\" you need to get through. One is a \"skills screen.\" We are trying to find out do you have the right skills to do the job? These could be very specific skills, like a programming language, carpentry, plumbing, etc.\n\nThe other is a \"behavioral screen.\" We are trying to figure out do you have the right personality, the right mindset for the job. For instance, the job might require a very high degree of teamwork.  We need to figure out if you can actually work effectively in a team. You may have amazing skills, but if you can't work in a team, then your skills don't matter. \n\nThe most common approach to the \"behavioral screen\" is to do somthing called a behavioral interview. In a behavioral interview, we tende to ask questions that start with \"Tell me about a time when...\" We are trying to understand past behavior, because while it is imperfect, it is the best indicator we have of future performance. Here is a typical example of a BI question on teamwork: \"Share an example of how you were able to motivate a coworker, your peers or your team.\"\n\nThere is a great deal of informaton on behavioral interviewing on-online. Here is a link to get you started from Indeed.\n\n[https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/most-common-behavioral-interview-questions-and-answers](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/most-common-behavioral-interview-questions-and-answers)\n\nTo bring this full circle, at my last company, we STARTED with a behavioral screen. Why? I can teach you skills like how to use Excel. It is WAY harder to teach you new behaviors. If you didn't come to the company with the right behaviors, no level of right skills mattered.",

I spoke to PlayfulMentor for a bit and it was so great just hashing out what I\u2019d like to do next. Surprisingly the most helpful part was getting asked questions I hadn\u2019t really thought about but that I do need to nail down to move forward. So even if you\u2019re not sure exactly what you want to do (maybe tech, maybe you\u2019re still figuring out your interests or if you should go back to school, etc.), take the opportunity to chat with someone who\u2019s established and at a point in their career where we likely all hope to be one day.",
