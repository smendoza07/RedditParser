    "body": "I just need to vent this out because it\u2019s been sitting on my mind for a few months. I see it all over social media (insta, Twitter, tiktok) of girls signing up for different sugar websites and becoming rinsers. They make tiktok videos explaining how to make money off SDs but all the \u201cadvice\u201d is how to get POTs to send money for texting and then ghost them if they try to meet up. \n\nI\u2019m so incredibly annoyed by this behavior because it\u2019s not sugaring at that point, you\u2019re just scamming men. It also gives SBs an incredibly bad rep and ruins it for everyone else. \n\nThe tiktok videos I\u2019ve seen essentially give the \u201cadvice\u201d of telling POTs \u201coh well my former SD gave me xxx a week just to text/talk, and when we get more comfortable, we can meet in person\u201d. They encourage never actually meeting in person, give a laundry list of excuses on why you can\u2019t meet, and overall just trash \u201cadvice\u201d. \n\nThis is absolutely terrible and dilutes the bowl for anyone actually seeking a true arrangement. I feel bad for SDs that fall into this trap and get taken advantage of by young girls desperate for money. \n\nCovid really had a harsh impact on the bowl (at least it feels like) and I can\u2019t help but feel the need to blame all these scammers for making the rest of the 18-25 y/o SBs look bad. \n\nAnyone else noticing this too? I can\u2019t be the only one going crazy by this. They paint SDs as lonely and gross men desperate for attention, but in my experience that\u2019s so far from the truth. Most SDs don\u2019t need your companionship, they give you money because they like seeing you succeed/happy. \n\nI feel like you can\u2019t even tell these girls \u201chey maybe don\u2019t ruin a good thing\u201d because they literally don\u2019t care. They\u2019re just in it for themselves at the end of the day.",

You\u2019re only \u201cseeing\u201d more of it now because of modern platforms. This business has never been easy to navigate; if it was, everyone would do it. Both SBs and SDs just need to know how to weed out he wrong ones and how to find the right ones. That has always been the case, and always will be. The wrong ones will always be weeded out from either side, it doesn\u2019t and won\u2019t benefit you in any way to spend your time and energy fuming over time wasters or fakes. In the long run, who is going to end up in a better arrangement/making more money, you, or the fake? Time is money, don\u2019t waste yours on things like this.",

I get the biggest kick outta those nitwits who think none of us have enough \"game\" to have any kind of a gorgeous companion just for the sake of spending time with someone. Puhleeze. \n\n> Most SDs don\u2019t need your companionship, they give you money because they like seeing you succeed/happy.\n\nSo much so this. \n\n> I feel like you can\u2019t even tell these girls \u201chey maybe don\u2019t ruin a good thing\u201d because they literally don\u2019t care. They\u2019re just in it for themselves at the end of the day.\n\nNo worries. Real SD's spot their bullshit from MILES away and avoid them. Hopefully the only ones they get are the one-hit-wonder chumps who usually are only fooled once, or the RedPill Daddies that turn the tables on them.",

Set a day, my goal is 300 a day!***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLove this comment:\n\nHey girl, could you make one more video on how you should talk to them?\n\nJust explaining what convos to have since we have to talk to them a lot.",

They\u2019re annoying, but the \u201c90% of women on SA want online only\u201d posts on this sub are just not true. There are plenty of women willing to meet in real life without expecting money in advance.\n\nI\u2019m sure there are some TikTok scammers making a few bucks, but no one is making xxx/day doing this. If someone asks for money before meeting and you report them SA will ban their account. Also, even if someone does fall for this trap all online payments can easily be disputed and reversed even if they\u2019re legitimately sent.",

That being said I made an extremely vanilla profile on SA just to look around.   Granted I only look around at maybe 20-30 profiles but I was a bit taken back by the demands women have up on most of the profiles.  Usually something along the lines of wanted - male, 25-35, must be fit, must pay me xyz amount PPM or per month, must be single, must do this, must do that... I mean the list of demands went on and on.  Really turned me off.... I mean it seemed like these women wanted the top 1-5% of the dating pool of men looks wise, the top 1% of men money wise, and expect them to be single, that man doesn't exist in the bowl.  The men that do fit those criteria have a \"black book\" filled with women that will come visit them for free any time they want.  Maybe I just didn't search long enough, but if that is the criteria SBs expect I don't see how SR come about these days.",

That takes me and my sugar fund out of the bowl along with anyone else who feels the same way.   \n\n\nSA isn't going to crack down on it because they need the numbers to keep rising and new girls (real or fake) on the site to keep men interested and coming back for more.   \n\n\nSA doesn't care about making it harder for SB or SD to find each other, they just focus on growth and maybe an eventual exit.   \n\n\nSorry to crash your thread ladies, you all look amazing and skinny as ever. Whatever you're doing, it's working, keep it up.",
