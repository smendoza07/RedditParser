Hes definitely the one that utilizes its full potential, unlike most people who had it who use it teleporting ability and end there. Hes also an Uzumaki so has a naturally strong life force, and definitely has one of the strongest out of any Uzumaki because it's said that summoning the geto statue = instant death to the summoner, but nagato lived close to 20 years after summoning it and was still able to have his clones use all the renigans 6 paths. And his Chakra rivals that of the tailed beast themselves, as he was able to constantly pump Chakra into his 6 paths of pein and spam renigan with no issue. Unlike Sasuke who runs out of Chakra almost instantly after using it. And Sasuke doesn't even use its full abilities like nagato. Nagato is definitely bijuu level, and could probally best every tailed beast besides 9 and 10 tails. To put in perspective, Naruto with only half the 9 tails was able to destroy the tailed beast being controlled by renigan. And the tailed beast are noted to be stronger and more powerful then almost anybody on the planet, and they have the feats to prove it. Atleast kurama does. Also, something that shouldn't be taken lightly is black zetsus reaction to obito thinking nagato could lose. Black zetsu has seen literally every event in human history since kaguyas death, and has naturally seen every strong shinobi or prodigy, but he still couldn't believe the possibility of nagato losing. And honestly id have to agree with him because nagato was already drained of Chakra and on the verge of death before even starting his attack on the leaf as shown when him and konan have their talk before the attack starts. And he was still able to wipe out the entire village, turn it into a crater, with 1 jutsu. Then fought sage mode Naruto, half of kurama up to 8 tails state before Naruto got turned back to sage mode. And he generally held his own and almost won with his planetary devastation. The same jutsu used on kaguya. \n\nSo yes, hes just that strong.",

Something people forget when bringing itachi into discussions of strength is that by the end of series, he's not physically strong. Not anymore atleast. His sickness weakened him to the point where physically he wasn't on par with people the 6 paths of pain and Naruto. The only thing he has is his sharigan, which is one of the strongest in the series, but if it doesn't work then he's getting shit on because nagato IS insanely physically talented and strong.

I still find it highy unlikely and impossible that they came from kaguya though. As kaguya only had 2 children. 1 formed the hyuga, while the other had 2 sons. 1 who formed the senju and another who formed the Uchiha. I find it more likely they descend from another Otsutsuki. Like ishikki.  I don't know much about current boruto or ishikki, but I've heard from multiple people that ishikki and kaguya came to earth together. So its possible he had children who formed the kaguya clan",

But im open to it, because we know jack shit about the hyuga side of the spectrum like HOW THE FUCK THEY GOT TO EARTH FROM THE FUCKING MOON! THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO FLY IS HAGURA HIMSELF! But I digress. \n\nIm pretty confient in saying hagura only had 1 child and passed on ALL his abilities to that child. If not all then most. Including body. Because the otsosuki in the last is actually a hyuga that's closer related to hagura, but has the body of hagura. Also, hagura didn't inherit the bone abilities. None of the children do. Atleast we don't see it. The ability seems to be more in line with the renigan since I'm pretty sure renigan obito does it. And kaguya doesn't show any bone manipulation at all. Just that 1 jutsu which is still struggle to call bone manipulation. Atleast not the manipulation of her own bones. \n\nAnyway, something I just remembered is that we actually see all of his direct descendant in 1 shot, besides the hyuga of earth, and all have byakugon. It's more likely in my mind that they are just devout followers of kaguya and have their own kekei genkai because this all stems from the thought that they are the same kekei genkai. Which from what we've seen isn't true. Or atleast not completely. People seem to forget that other people and clans can have kekei genkai",

It might be a really far stretch if they weren't also direct decendants from brothers.

It would work, just not to the same effect as others. She's a medic. Not only does she have great control, she can heal herself of any damage so he would be wasting chakra. She's way stronger than anyone else that got caught in it plus she has specific knowledge on how to cure any issues. \n\nShisui can stab Tsunade all he wants, he ain't going to be able to kill her in one shot and you don't want to get in close to her. She's not slow by any measure and is way beyond Shisui level. I mean his speed didn't help him much against Danzo and some Root, you know. What, you think Tsunade wouldn't smoke pre-shisui eye Danzo? His flunkies aren't even close to touching her.  \n\nYeah, plot armor and nerfs aside, Tsunade should be wrecking pretty much any of these.",

Hes definitely the one that utilizes its full potential, unlike most people who had it who use it teleporting ability and end there. Hes also an Uzumaki so has a naturally strong life force, and definitely has one of the strongest out of any Uzumaki because it's said that summoning the geto statue = instant death to the summoner, but nagato lived close to 20 years after summoning it and was still able to have his clones use all the renigans 6 paths. And his Chakra rivals that of the tailed beast themselves, as he was able to constantly pump Chakra into his 6 paths of pein and spam renigan with no issue. Unlike Sasuke who runs out of Chakra almost instantly after using it. And Sasuke doesn't even use its full abilities like nagato. Nagato is definitely bijuu level, and could probally best every tailed beast besides 9 and 10 tails. To put in perspective, Naruto with only half the 9 tails was able to destroy the tailed beast being controlled by renigan. And the tailed beast are noted to be stronger and more powerful then almost anybody on the planet, and they have the feats to prove it. Atleast kurama does. Also, something that shouldn't be taken lightly is black zetsus reaction to obito thinking nagato could lose. Black zetsu has seen literally every event in human history since kaguyas death, and has naturally seen every strong shinobi or prodigy, but he still couldn't believe the possibility of nagato losing. And honestly id have to agree with him because nagato was already drained of Chakra and on the verge of death before even starting his attack on the leaf as shown when him and konan have their talk before the attack starts. And he was still able to wipe out the entire village, turn it into a crater, with 1 jutsu. Then fought sage mode Naruto, half of kurama up to 8 tails state before Naruto got turned back to sage mode. And he generally held his own and almost won with his planetary devastation. The same jutsu used on kaguya. \n\nSo yes, hes just that strong.",

One gets the eyes (Hyuuga) and the other inherits the body (Kaguya).

But im open to it, because we know jack shit about the hyuga side of the spectrum like HOW THE FUCK THEY GOT TO EARTH FROM THE FUCKING MOON! THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO FLY IS HAGURA HIMSELF! But I digress. \n\nIm pretty confient in saying hagura only had 1 child and passed on ALL his abilities to that child. If not all then most. Including body. Because the otsosuki in the last is actually a hyuga that's closer related to hagura, but has the body of hagura. Also, hagura didn't inherit the bone abilities. None of the children do. Atleast we don't see it. The ability seems to be more in line with the renigan since I'm pretty sure renigan obito does it. And kaguya doesn't show any bone manipulation at all. Just that 1 jutsu which is still struggle to call bone manipulation. Atleast not the manipulation of her own bones. \n\nAnyway, something I just remembered is that we actually see all of his direct descendant in 1 shot, besides the hyuga of earth, and all have byakugon. It's more likely in my mind that they are just devout followers of kaguya and have their own kekei genkai because this all stems from the thought that they are the same kekei genkai. Which from what we've seen isn't true. Or atleast not completely. People seem to forget that other people and clans can have kekei genkai",

She's not slow by any measure and is way beyond Shisui level. I mean his speed didn't help him much against Danzo and some Root, you know. What, you think Tsunade wouldn't smoke pre-shisui eye Danzo?

Hes definitely the one that utilizes its full potential, unlike most people who had it who use it teleporting ability and end there. Hes also an Uzumaki so has a naturally strong life force, and definitely has one of the strongest out of any Uzumaki because it's said that summoning the geto statue = instant death to the summoner, but nagato lived close to 20 years after summoning it and was still able to have his clones use all the renigans 6 paths. And his Chakra rivals that of the tailed beast themselves, as he was able to constantly pump Chakra into his 6 paths of pein and spam renigan with no issue. Unlike Sasuke who runs out of Chakra almost instantly after using it. And Sasuke doesn't even use its full abilities like nagato. Nagato is definitely bijuu level, and could probally best every tailed beast besides 9 and 10 tails. To put in perspective, Naruto with only half the 9 tails was able to destroy the tailed beast being controlled by renigan. And the tailed beast are noted to be stronger and more powerful then almost anybody on the planet, and they have the feats to prove it. Atleast kurama does. Also, something that shouldn't be taken lightly is black zetsus reaction to obito thinking nagato could lose. Black zetsu has seen literally every event in human history since kaguyas death, and has naturally seen every strong shinobi or prodigy, but he still couldn't believe the possibility of nagato losing. And honestly id have to agree with him because nagato was already drained of Chakra and on the verge of death before even starting his attack on the leaf as shown when him and konan have their talk before the attack starts. And he was still able to wipe out the entire village, turn it into a crater, with 1 jutsu. Then fought sage mode Naruto, half of kurama up to 8 tails state before Naruto got turned back to sage mode. And he generally held his own and almost won with his planetary devastation. The same jutsu used on kaguya. \n\nSo yes, hes just that strong.",

And having similar jutsu doesn't make family or descendant with the kazekages being good examples. The 3rd kazekage has practically the same jutsu as the 4th and gaara, but the 3rd isn't family to them and actually created the kekei genkai based off shukakus sand control so its possible, if kaguya does have bone manipulation i don't remember seeing, that kimimaros clan just copied it to an extent",

Like ishikki.  I don't know much about current boruto or ishikki, but I've heard from multiple people that ishikki and kaguya came to earth together. So its possible he had children who formed the kaguya clan",

But im open to it, because we know jack shit about the hyuga side of the spectrum like HOW THE FUCK THEY GOT TO EARTH FROM THE FUCKING MOON! THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO FLY IS HAGURA HIMSELF! But I digress. \n\nIm pretty confient in saying hagura only had 1 child and passed on ALL his abilities to that child. If not all then most. Including body. Because the otsosuki in the last is actually a hyuga that's closer related to hagura, but has the body of hagura. Also, hagura didn't inherit the bone abilities. None of the children do. Atleast we don't see it. The ability seems to be more in line with the renigan since I'm pretty sure renigan obito does it. And kaguya doesn't show any bone manipulation at all. Just that 1 jutsu which is still struggle to call bone manipulation. Atleast not the manipulation of her own bones. \n\nAnyway, something I just remembered is that we actually see all of his direct descendant in 1 shot, besides the hyuga of earth, and all have byakugon. It's more likely in my mind that they are just devout followers of kaguya and have their own kekei genkai because this all stems from the thought that they are the same kekei genkai. Which from what we've seen isn't true. Or atleast not completely. People seem to forget that other people and clans can have kekei genkai",

She's not slow by any measure and is way beyond Shisui level. I mean his speed didn't help him much against Danzo and some Root, you know. What, you think Tsunade wouldn't smoke pre-shisui eye Danzo?

Hes definitely the one that utilizes its full potential, unlike most people who had it who use it teleporting ability and end there. Hes also an Uzumaki so has a naturally strong life force, and definitely has one of the strongest out of any Uzumaki because it's said that summoning the geto statue = instant death to the summoner, but nagato lived close to 20 years after summoning it and was still able to have his clones use all the renigans 6 paths. And his Chakra rivals that of the tailed beast themselves, as he was able to constantly pump Chakra into his 6 paths of pein and spam renigan with no issue. Unlike Sasuke who runs out of Chakra almost instantly after using it. And Sasuke doesn't even use its full abilities like nagato. Nagato is definitely bijuu level, and could probally best every tailed beast besides 9 and 10 tails. To put in perspective, Naruto with only half the 9 tails was able to destroy the tailed beast being controlled by renigan. And the tailed beast are noted to be stronger and more powerful then almost anybody on the planet, and they have the feats to prove it. Atleast kurama does. Also, something that shouldn't be taken lightly is black zetsus reaction to obito thinking nagato could lose. Black zetsu has seen literally every event in human history since kaguyas death, and has naturally seen every strong shinobi or prodigy, but he still couldn't believe the possibility of nagato losing. And honestly id have to agree with him because nagato was already drained of Chakra and on the verge of death before even starting his attack on the leaf as shown when him and konan have their talk before the attack starts. And he was still able to wipe out the entire village, turn it into a crater, with 1 jutsu. Then fought sage mode Naruto, half of kurama up to 8 tails state before Naruto got turned back to sage mode. And he generally held his own and almost won with his planetary devastation. The same jutsu used on kaguya. \n\nSo yes, hes just that strong.",

One gets the eyes (Hyuuga) and the other inherits the body (Kaguya).

But im open to it, because we know jack shit about the hyuga side of the spectrum like HOW THE FUCK THEY GOT TO EARTH FROM THE FUCKING MOON! THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO FLY IS HAGURA HIMSELF! But I digress. \n\nIm pretty confient in saying hagura only had 1 child and passed on ALL his abilities to that child. If not all then most. Including body. Because the otsosuki in the last is actually a hyuga that's closer related to hagura, but has the body of hagura. Also, hagura didn't inherit the bone abilities. None of the children do. Atleast we don't see it. The ability seems to be more in line with the renigan since I'm pretty sure renigan obito does it. And kaguya doesn't show any bone manipulation at all. Just that 1 jutsu which is still struggle to call bone manipulation. Atleast not the manipulation of her own bones. \n\nAnyway, something I just remembered is that we actually see all of his direct descendant in 1 shot, besides the hyuga of earth, and all have byakugon. It's more likely in my mind that they are just devout followers of kaguya and have their own kekei genkai because this all stems from the thought that they are the same kekei genkai. Which from what we've seen isn't true. Or atleast not completely. People seem to forget that other people and clans can have kekei genkai",

Hes definitely the one that utilizes its full potential, unlike most people who had it who use it teleporting ability and end there. Hes also an Uzumaki so has a naturally strong life force, and definitely has one of the strongest out of any Uzumaki because it's said that summoning the geto statue = instant death to the summoner, but nagato lived close to 20 years after summoning it and was still able to have his clones use all the renigans 6 paths. And his Chakra rivals that of the tailed beast themselves, as he was able to constantly pump Chakra into his 6 paths of pein and spam renigan with no issue. Unlike Sasuke who runs out of Chakra almost instantly after using it. And Sasuke doesn't even use its full abilities like nagato. Nagato is definitely bijuu level, and could probally best every tailed beast besides 9 and 10 tails. To put in perspective, Naruto with only half the 9 tails was able to destroy the tailed beast being controlled by renigan. And the tailed beast are noted to be stronger and more powerful then almost anybody on the planet, and they have the feats to prove it. Atleast kurama does. Also, something that shouldn't be taken lightly is black zetsus reaction to obito thinking nagato could lose. Black zetsu has seen literally every event in human history since kaguyas death, and has naturally seen every strong shinobi or prodigy, but he still couldn't believe the possibility of nagato losing. And honestly id have to agree with him because nagato was already drained of Chakra and on the verge of death before even starting his attack on the leaf as shown when him and konan have their talk before the attack starts. And he was still able to wipe out the entire village, turn it into a crater, with 1 jutsu. Then fought sage mode Naruto, half of kurama up to 8 tails state before Naruto got turned back to sage mode. And he generally held his own and almost won with his planetary devastation. The same jutsu used on kaguya. \n\nSo yes, hes just that strong.",

The only thing he has is his sharigan, which is one of the strongest in the series, but if it doesn't work then he's getting shit on because nagato IS insanely physically talented and strong.

One gets the eyes (Hyuuga) and the other inherits the body (Kaguya).

But im open to it, because we know jack shit about the hyuga side of the spectrum like HOW THE FUCK THEY GOT TO EARTH FROM THE FUCKING MOON! THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO FLY IS HAGURA HIMSELF! But I digress. \n\nIm pretty confient in saying hagura only had 1 child and passed on ALL his abilities to that child. If not all then most. Including body. Because the otsosuki in the last is actually a hyuga that's closer related to hagura, but has the body of hagura. Also, hagura didn't inherit the bone abilities. None of the children do. Atleast we don't see it. The ability seems to be more in line with the renigan since I'm pretty sure renigan obito does it. And kaguya doesn't show any bone manipulation at all. Just that 1 jutsu which is still struggle to call bone manipulation. Atleast not the manipulation of her own bones. \n\nAnyway, something I just remembered is that we actually see all of his direct descendant in 1 shot, besides the hyuga of earth, and all have byakugon. It's more likely in my mind that they are just devout followers of kaguya and have their own kekei genkai because this all stems from the thought that they are the same kekei genkai. Which from what we've seen isn't true. Or atleast not completely. People seem to forget that other people and clans can have kekei genkai",

            "body": "Nagato is actually that strong id say. He has the highest mastery of the renigan we've seen besides possibly Sasuke, kaguya and hagoromo. Hes definitely the one that utilizes its full potential, unlike most people who had it who use it teleporting ability and end there. Hes also an Uzumaki so has a naturally strong life force, and definitely has one of the strongest out of any Uzumaki because it's said that summoning the geto statue = instant death to the summoner, but nagato lived close to 20 years after summoning it and was still able to have his clones use all the renigans 6 paths. And his Chakra rivals that of the tailed beast themselves, as he was able to constantly pump Chakra into his 6 paths of pein and spam renigan with no issue. Unlike Sasuke who runs out of Chakra almost instantly after using it. And Sasuke doesn't even use its full abilities like nagato. Nagato is definitely bijuu level, and could probally best every tailed beast besides 9 and 10 tails. To put in perspective, Naruto with only half the 9 tails was able to destroy the tailed beast being controlled by renigan. And the tailed beast are noted to be stronger and more powerful then almost anybody on the planet, and they have the feats to prove it. Atleast kurama does. Also, something that shouldn't be taken lightly is black zetsus reaction to obito thinking nagato could lose. Black zetsu has seen literally every event in human history since kaguyas death, and has naturally seen every strong shinobi or prodigy, but he still couldn't believe the possibility of nagato losing. And honestly id have to agree with him because nagato was already drained of Chakra and on the verge of death before even starting his attack on the leaf as shown when him and konan have their talk before the attack starts. And he was still able to wipe out the entire village, turn it into a crater, with 1 jutsu. Then fought sage mode Naruto, half of kurama up to 8 tails state before Naruto got turned back to sage mode. And he generally held his own and almost won with his planetary devastation. The same jutsu used on kaguya. \n\nSo yes, hes just that strong.",

One gets the eyes (Hyuuga) and the other inherits the body (Kaguya). They probably weren't talked about as much since they went functionally extinct when Kimimaro was a kid, and then completely extinct when he died.",

But im open to it, because we know jack shit about the hyuga side of the spectrum like HOW THE FUCK THEY GOT TO EARTH FROM THE FUCKING MOON! THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO FLY IS HAGURA HIMSELF! But I digress. \n\nIm pretty confient in saying hagura only had 1 child and passed on ALL his abilities to that child. If not all then most. Including body. Because the otsosuki in the last is actually a hyuga that's closer related to hagura, but has the body of hagura. Also, hagura didn't inherit the bone abilities. None of the children do. Atleast we don't see it. The ability seems to be more in line with the renigan since I'm pretty sure renigan obito does it. And kaguya doesn't show any bone manipulation at all. Just that 1 jutsu which is still struggle to call bone manipulation. Atleast not the manipulation of her own bones. \n\nAnyway, something I just remembered is that we actually see all of his direct descendant in 1 shot, besides the hyuga of earth, and all have byakugon. It's more likely in my mind that they are just devout followers of kaguya and have their own kekei genkai because this all stems from the thought that they are the same kekei genkai. Which from what we've seen isn't true. Or atleast not completely. People seem to forget that other people and clans can have kekei genkai",

One gets the eyes (Hyuuga) and the other inherits the body (Kaguya). They probably weren't talked about as much since they went functionally extinct when Kimimaro was a kid, and then completely extinct when he died.",

But im open to it, because we know jack shit about the hyuga side of the spectrum like HOW THE FUCK THEY GOT TO EARTH FROM THE FUCKING MOON! THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO FLY IS HAGURA HIMSELF! But I digress. \n\nIm pretty confient in saying hagura only had 1 child and passed on ALL his abilities to that child. If not all then most. Including body. Because the otsosuki in the last is actually a hyuga that's closer related to hagura, but has the body of hagura. Also, hagura didn't inherit the bone abilities. None of the children do. Atleast we don't see it. The ability seems to be more in line with the renigan since I'm pretty sure renigan obito does it. And kaguya doesn't show any bone manipulation at all. Just that 1 jutsu which is still struggle to call bone manipulation. Atleast not the manipulation of her own bones. \n\nAnyway, something I just remembered is that we actually see all of his direct descendant in 1 shot, besides the hyuga of earth, and all have byakugon. It's more likely in my mind that they are just devout followers of kaguya and have their own kekei genkai because this all stems from the thought that they are the same kekei genkai. Which from what we've seen isn't true. Or atleast not completely. People seem to forget that other people and clans can have kekei genkai",

One gets the eyes (Hyuuga) and the other inherits the body (Kaguya). They probably weren't talked about as much since they went functionally extinct when Kimimaro was a kid, and then completely extinct when he died.",

But im open to it, because we know jack shit about the hyuga side of the spectrum like HOW THE FUCK THEY GOT TO EARTH FROM THE FUCKING MOON! THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO FLY IS HAGURA HIMSELF! But I digress. \n\nIm pretty confient in saying hagura only had 1 child and passed on ALL his abilities to that child. If not all then most. Including body. Because the otsosuki in the last is actually a hyuga that's closer related to hagura, but has the body of hagura. Also, hagura didn't inherit the bone abilities. None of the children do. Atleast we don't see it. The ability seems to be more in line with the renigan since I'm pretty sure renigan obito does it. And kaguya doesn't show any bone manipulation at all. Just that 1 jutsu which is still struggle to call bone manipulation. Atleast not the manipulation of her own bones. \n\nAnyway, something I just remembered is that we actually see all of his direct descendant in 1 shot, besides the hyuga of earth, and all have byakugon. It's more likely in my mind that they are just devout followers of kaguya and have their own kekei genkai because this all stems from the thought that they are the same kekei genkai. Which from what we've seen isn't true. Or atleast not completely. People seem to forget that other people and clans can have kekei genkai",

But im open to it, because we know jack shit about the hyuga side of the spectrum like HOW THE FUCK THEY GOT TO EARTH FROM THE FUCKING MOON! THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO FLY IS HAGURA HIMSELF! But I digress. \n\nIm pretty confient in saying hagura only had 1 child and passed on ALL his abilities to that child. If not all then most. Including body. Because the otsosuki in the last is actually a hyuga that's closer related to hagura, but has the body of hagura. Also, hagura didn't inherit the bone abilities. None of the children do. Atleast we don't see it. The ability seems to be more in line with the renigan since I'm pretty sure renigan obito does it. And kaguya doesn't show any bone manipulation at all. Just that 1 jutsu which is still struggle to call bone manipulation. Atleast not the manipulation of her own bones. \n\nAnyway, something I just remembered is that we actually see all of his direct descendant in 1 shot, besides the hyuga of earth, and all have byakugon. It's more likely in my mind that they are just devout followers of kaguya and have their own kekei genkai because this all stems from the thought that they are the same kekei genkai. Which from what we've seen isn't true. Or atleast not completely. People seem to forget that other people and clans can have kekei genkai",
