I'll be honest, it was super hard. And I didn't have the support/wasn't in a strong enough mental state to be aggressive about it. I've made my peace with my situation (basically dismissed by the male officer who took my statement and never reached out to the 3 eye witnesses I provided). While I've forgiven myself, there is still a part of me that wishes I'd been in a place to be relentless in pursuing justice, as hard as that may have been.\n\nIf you ever need to talk, please DM me.

That road is horrible, from often being mistreated just at the police report stage to everything that follows. Maybe it will help you heal, and if so go ahead.\n\nOtherwise, as others suggest, consider the civil route. Consider the \"move on\" route. Talk to an expert at RAINN or elsewhere. Don't suffer alone. Heal. Share your story. Don't be a victim, but rather a survivor.\n\nWe are all with you. This was not ok. It will never be ok.",

Trauma actually changes the way your brain functions, and the long term effects are terrible, but the good news is that the brain can be trained into functioning the way you want it to. \n\nI agree with another poster that mentioned making a civil claim. Rape is difficult to prosecute criminally. There are legal counsellors who can help explain the process to you, and support you throughout your journey (generally accessible from sexual assault centres).",
