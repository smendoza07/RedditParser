His point was that what makes an outfit beautiful, it's NOT the clothes itself, but the more famous and expensive it's the clothes, the more it's fashionable. I replied that what makes an outfit good-looking, it's how you match the color, the sizes  of your clothes: in a few words: your personal style.\nNow I try wear no brands clothes, and focus more on experimenting new matches, rather than just use fotocopy outfits, where price it's the only thing that matters",

His point was that what makes an outfit beautiful, it's NOT the clothes itself, but the more famous and expensive it's the clothes, the more it's fashionable. I replied that what makes an outfit good-looking, it's how you match the color, the sizes  of your clothes: in a few words: your personal style.\nNow I try wear no brands clothes, and focus more on experimenting new matches, rather than just use fotocopy outfits, where price it's the only thing that matters",
