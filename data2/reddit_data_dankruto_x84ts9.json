            "body": "**Unpopular Opinion** : Hiruzen wasn\u2019t wrong to treat Naruto and Sasuke like that. They shouldn't be treated as*privileged* *priviledged* children unlike other orphans, just because of their background.A child especially ninja should pass through tough times by themselves and develop learning and character. Otherwise they would become like Boruto. Of course he didn\u2019t completely stand on Naruto's parent's request, if it turned out to be for the greater good, as that\u2019s the we have the Naruto we know now. But it didn\u2019t turn well for Sasuke, because of Orochimaru and a triggering tragic past. I would also like to add that Naruto didn\u2019t turn evil because of his strong mentality and unhateful mindset. It wouldn\u2019t have turned out that way if there was some other kid in the place of Naruto. But Hiruzen cannot do anything as people's way of treating Naruto is the problem here (even after imposing law against ill treating Naruto). So I would say that Hiruzen wasn\u2019t wrong in treating Naruto and Sasuke like that, but he was a little **Reckless** regarding their mental health( especially Sasuke ) which didn\u2019t turn out well for Sasuke.I know this is a long ass comment",

It starts to feel like the kids fault in the eyes of the adult, because, \"They act out so much.

And Naruto comes to terms with how badly even Hiruzen treated him  growing up, so much that he no longer respects him or really even likes him like he used to. He feels betrayed and hurt and angry, USED. (And eventually, Naruto and Konohamaru talk about it so Konohamaru can understand why Naruto feels the way he does - and it opens Konohamaru's eyes to the person his grandpa REALLY was, not just the smiling old man in his memories, which is a very important step for his character!) >:D)",
