First off, it wouldn\u2019t do if the new generation\u2019s InoShikaChou wasn\u2019t made, so although I did think \u2018I wonder if I\u2019m being a little pushy\u2019, I decided to get Chouji and Karui together.\n\n\r  \nQ: In the manga, Chouji\u2019s father Chouza called women who liked stout men like themselves \u2018fetish\u2019 holders. Then, as expected, does Karui have a fetish too?\n\n\r  \nKishimoto: No, rather than saying she has a fetish, it\u2019s just that she\u2019s very easygoing. She easily gives decisions about everything, and so she OK\u2019d the marriage very simply. \u201cSure,\u201d like that. -laughs-",

Which is kinda stupid if you think about it. Every single female in Naruto loves the same guy forever even if he dies. Well, except Ino, but she replaced her love for Sasuke with love for a guy who is a 1:1 copy of Sasuke.",

People demand such deep reasons that require chapters and chapters of \"MUH DEVELUPMENT\" and years of characters getting to know each other and finally coming to a decision... and Kishimoto comes around and says \"She's just easygoing and makes decisions easily.\"\n\nLike, they think that with love, decisions are something that comes to you like a passive thing. And Karui subverts that bullshit and owns it. Decisions are active. They are *something that you make*.\n\nJust like how Boruto's \"resolve\" let him decide instantly whether to take medicine that may or may not kill him after Naruto tells him to decide carefully. If readers can accept characters making choices quickly (nobody's having a debate over whether Boruto made a good or bad decision), they should be able to accept that characters can decide to get married.",

Then, as expected, does Karui have a fetish too?\n\n\r  \nKishimoto: No, rather than saying she has a fetish, it\u2019s just that she\u2019s very easygoing.

Well, except Ino, but she replaced her love for Sasuke with love for a guy who is a 1:1 copy of Sasuke.",

And Karui subverts that bullshit and owns it. Decisions are active. They are *something that you make*.\n\nJust like how Boruto's \"resolve\" let him decide instantly whether to take medicine that may or may not kill him after Naruto tells him to decide carefully.

People demand such deep reasons that require chapters and chapters of \"MUH DEVELUPMENT\" and years of characters getting to know each other and finally coming to a decision... and Kishimoto comes around and says \"She's just easygoing and makes decisions easily.\"\n\nLike, they think that with love, decisions are something that comes to you like a passive thing. And Karui subverts that bullshit and owns it. Decisions are active. They are *something that you make*.\n\nJust like how Boruto's \"resolve\" let him decide instantly whether to take medicine that may or may not kill him after Naruto tells him to decide carefully. If readers can accept characters making choices quickly (nobody's having a debate over whether Boruto made a good or bad decision), they should be able to accept that characters can decide to get married.",
