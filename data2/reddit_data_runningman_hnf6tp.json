            "body": "The very first episode of Running Man that I ever watched was Episode 302 because I am a Twice fan. Initially wanted to watch the girls but ended up falling in love with Running Man. This first episode is super great because there was a feast right at the start and anything they placed in their plate, they must harvest/collect them. That's the very first moment I saw Kwangsoo and I love him at first sight because he glazed Honey on his strawberries. Jaesuk gave him hell all throughout the episode because they had to go to a bee farm and it was hard to collect honey. So Jaesuk kept on pestering Kwangsoo with \"who puts honey on their strawberries when they eat it?\". My first Running Man moment is definitely a memorable one.",

But turns out the new mission was to catch everything they DIDN'T eat\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Ahh I love watching the global episodes, they're so fun!
