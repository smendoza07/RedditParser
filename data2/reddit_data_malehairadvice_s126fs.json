When the hair is thinning or gone in an area, the follicles have moved towards the top layer of the skin, and it takes many shedding cycles for the hair to move back down and become healthy again.",

            "body": "Sorry this is so late fellas. Started a new job and moved into my first apartment recently, so I\u2019ve been a bit distracted. \n\nI was honestly hesitant to post this 1-year update because I figured you guys would be a little disappointed, but I wanted to be honest with everyone. To me it appears my results reached their peak around month 8. I haven\u2019t noticed any further results since then (granted; I did have to stop taking Minoxidil for about a month back in October when I was in-between jobs and didn\u2019t want to spare the money), but I really shouldn\u2019t complain considering how bad things had gotten back in November of 2020 for my hair. I\u2019ve also missed a few doses of Finasteride and neglected to use Minoxidil 2x per day on several occasions the last three months, so I\u2019m sure that hasn\u2019t helped. I just got really busy and kept forgetting at times.\n\nSO\u2014 here is what I\u2019ve learned over the last year of this experiment:\n\n1.) The side effects are NOT a guarantee. I never once had E.D. in any capacity throughout this whole thing.\n2.) I certainly noticed a difference when I would derma-roll before putting on the Minoxidil. I\u2019d do it once a month after showering and before my nightly application. I eventually stopped, thinking it wasn\u2019t doing anything, but then noticed that my scalp didn\u2019t seem to be absorbing the medicine as well so I started doing it again. \n3.) If using Minoxidil; your results will be better if you keep your hair shorter. I noticed that when I grew my hair longer it made it more difficult for the minoxidil to actually saturate my scalp because most of it was just soaking into the hair itself. It might just be my application process, so who knows. Just thought I\u2019d make it known. \n4.) The longer you wait to start on this, the smaller your results will be. My crown began thinning at the end of 2016. The rest started to go early 2019, and got REALLY bad mid-2020. Even after an entire year of medicinal therapy my crown is still pretty thin. MUCH better than the last few years of my life, but still not where I want it to be comfortable. My hairline and top density is doing well and I\u2019m satisfied enough. \n5.) Even if your hair grows back it will never be the same. My current texture is far different than it ever has been. My coverage is decent but the actual *quality* of those hairs leaves a lot to be desired. The new hairs I\u2019ve regrown are thin, wiry, and seem to flat-out REFUSE to grow past a certain length. I had a natural mullet from months 5-8.\n6.) I\u2019ve been informed that Minoxidil is poisonous to cats (?) if ingested, so if you have a cat PLEASE make sure you lock it out of the bathroom while applying. Not sure if that is true, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the risk by ignoring it. Any time I spend the night at a friend\u2019s house who owns a cat I sleep in a beanie to be extra safe. \n7.) Missing a dose of Finasteride from time-to-time isn\u2019t a huge deal. It takes 3-5 months for it to start working in your system, missing one day every month or so won\u2019t derail your progress. Don\u2019t stress about it, and don\u2019t double-up on doses if you missed the day before. You\u2019ll be ok. \n\nAnd to answer a few questions that I will inevitably get: NO, I did not get erectile dysfunction at any point during this. NO, I did not get a hair transplant (but I totally would if I could afford it). YES, the pictures are all of the same guy (me). YES, this stuff will need to be taken for the rest of my life if I wish to keep my hair, unless they develop a cure for MPB. YES, I intend on taking this for as long as I can pay for the pills. \n\nI\u2019m happy to answer any questions you may have, but if you ask me a question I\u2019ve already addressed in this post I will ignore it. I\u2019m tired of typing the same response to people on a daily basis. \n\nHang in there guys!",

Once that prescription runs out you\u2019ll need to have your doctor write a new one. Since then it\u2019s been a bit more random for me. I\u2019ve been written one month supplies, and three month supplies. Not sure why it\u2019s all over the place, but I\u2019m just happy to get it. Haha",

I\u2019ve been written one month supplies, and three month supplies. Not sure why it\u2019s all over the place, but I\u2019m just happy to get it. Haha",

My first prescription I was written was for a 9-month supply. So I was given 3 refills with 90 pills in each bottle (3 month supply per bottle). Once that prescription runs out you\u2019ll need to have your doctor write a new one. Since then it\u2019s been a bit more random for me. I\u2019ve been written one month supplies, and three month supplies. Not sure why it\u2019s all over the place, but I\u2019m just happy to get it. Haha",

My first prescription I was written was for a 9-month supply. So I was given 3 refills with 90 pills in each bottle (3 month supply per bottle). Once that prescription runs out you\u2019ll need to have your doctor write a new one. Since then it\u2019s been a bit more random for me. I\u2019ve been written one month supplies, and three month supplies. Not sure why it\u2019s all over the place, but I\u2019m just happy to get it. Haha",
