Been a fan since Family Outing.\n\nI expected some people here already so sick of this couple for their own personal reasons and I won't be invalidating their feelings about it, but it's expected that this will be a running gag for a while. It does seem that they're aware that people have found some of their actions uncomfortable so they shall be cautious about it.\n\nEdit: removed last part.",
