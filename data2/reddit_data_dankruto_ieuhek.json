Like, do people just assume that minato and Kushina just happened across a baby while they were fighting the 9-tails, and that baby was also an orphan. Plus, he had the same last name as kushina.",

We as viewers didn't know anything about Minato's wife And theres no mentioning of any Uzumaki by anyone untill we come to know that Minato's wife was an Uzumaki. The only connection we had to Minato and Naruto was his yellow hair.",
