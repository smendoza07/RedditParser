    "body": "Hopefully this won\u2019t be seen as a waste of a post to read, but I thought I would just share a story of my first ever SR meetup, overseas nonetheless.\n\nSo I am an American businessman who works in China. I used to fly back and forth a lot, but post-COVID I am now working permanently out of China. Bluntly, I spent my youth in the States working and never took the time for a relationship other than the random hookup, which were fun but otherwise unmemorable.\n\nMeeting women in China as a foreigner is really hard. There\u2019s the language barrier (which I\u2019m working on learning, but Chinese is no joke) and most women are looking for marriage or a casual fling. There\u2019s also a culture among Chinese girls of \u201ctrying white once\u201d as a reason to hookup, meaning there\u2019s not a lot of interest in you as a person. When it comes to marriage, being a foreigner typically means you would never be really accepted by her family, removing you from serious consideration other than a one-time thing.\n\nI\u2019m not interested in marriage; life is too busy and I\u2019m never able to commit to being there for someone due to my work. But finding someone to spend the time in life I do have to give is something I\u2019ve been longing for. Sex is great of course, but feels empty without a person to connect with beyond that, at least for me.\n\nA friend recommended SA years ago, and I was too scared or judgmental (or both) at the time to bother. Life has taught me more lessons recently, and one of those was to learn to broaden my horizons. I decided to check out SA, but expected absolutely nothing to be there in China. After all, no Chinese girl would be on there, it\u2019s not the kind of thing that would happen over here, right?\n\nBoy was I wrong. First off, there was every kind of girl. Housewives looking for excitement, students looking for support, even doctors looking for something to cure boredom. I realized I had no idea what I wanted to look for, other than someone to get to know. Then I saw this one profile that made me bust out laughing.\n\nThere was this 22 year old girl who had taken a photo of herself running into a door. Legit full on impact photo with her face in the funniest expression I\u2019ve seen. I was smitten and sent her a message. Literally I was scared out of my mind, thinking I was about to be doxxed and blackmailed. What was I doing? I almost deleted my profile 3 times in unnecessary fear.\n\nThen 8 hours later I got a response. We chatted for a moment until she sent me her WeChat info to add her (Chinese version of social media). Her profile had no picture which had me a little worried, but she seemed really nice. And her English was almost flawless. Turns out she had spent 6 years in school in Canada, and was interning at a bank until she could return to finish her degree.\n\nWe agreed to meet at a restaurant 5 days later, and I was about to sweat bullets the whole time. But I was so excited to meet her and see what she would be like. She seemed attractive by her photo, but I was not...prepared for what was coming. I arrived first at the restaurant and got a table, and she sent me a message she was running 5 minutes late. I was looking at the menu when I felt two hands on my shoulders...\u201dHey there!\u201d. I turned around and mentally just froze.\n\nI have dated a couple pretty girls in my life, I hooked up with a 9 once who was a really cool girl. I am maybe a 7 these days, in shape but no model or anything. There is literally no way I was ever prepared to be eating dinner with an 11/10. This girl was beyond gorgeous. Imagine girl next door combined with the body of a figure skater. But that wasn\u2019t the best part.\n\nShe walked around the table and sat down, promptly knocking off a glass on the table. She reached to grab it, and then emptied the entire contents of her purse on the floor that was still on her shoulder. She was probably the clumsiest person I\u2019ve encountered, but constantly blushed and stammered the entire night.\n\nTurns out she was as nervous as me. She\u2019s bi, has dated Chinese guys and Canadian girls, but had never had an SR with a white guy before. We talked at the restaurant for hours, and when we went to leave, I asked her how she felt. She turned bright red and told me to call her when I was ready to meet again, and she was excited to be with me.\n\nI went home floored. That night was more exciting than any hookup. I don\u2019t know why. I sent her a message to meet me for lunch in a week, and I would get a hotel room for us. I booked a room at the best place in the city, and arranged a reservation at a restaurant she picked.\n\nWhen we met up, she continued her clumsiness, dumping her chopsticks on the floor. Cute doesn\u2019t even begin to describe her. After lunch, we went to the hotel room, and after showering I expected her to treat this like a service more than a relationship. I mean, holy shit, just looking at her was unbelievable. But it was no service. She literally grabbed me like a sailor finding shore after 6 months. It was really evident within moments she was as into me as I was her. She had a fantasy I would find out later of being in a relationship with an older white guy, and either she was an Academy award winning actress or I got really lucky. I\u2019ll put my money on the latter.\n\nAfterward, we laid on the bed naked for 3 hours talking, laughing, listening to her playlist (some rap music that I don\u2019t know), talking about dreams, until she fell asleep on my arm. I woke her up an hour later to tell her I had to go. I put a large deposit to cover any room charges and told her to stay the night here if she wanted and treat herself to room service. Yesterday, the hotel auto-refunded my deposit. She didn\u2019t spend a dime of it.\n\nWe\u2019re going on a date next week, just to go see a movie. No sex planned. And I couldn\u2019t be happier. Strangely she seems just as happy. I am supporting her monthly, and she bought a laptop because she likes to online game. She\u2019s bringing it over next week so we can LAN party.\n\nIf you were like me and not sure about SR, don\u2019t assume it may not be for you. I\u2019m fairly aware I got lucky off the bat, but if I can someone like this, anyone can. Sorry for judging this community beforehand. I\u2019ve learned a lot.",

Second of all, this is not a vanilla relationship and they met under the dynamic of SB/SD and on a site *specifically* for sugaring.\n\nI don't think you understand the dynamics or context of these sorts of relationships. Without a man providing and stepping up and leading and showing his generosity, what incentive is there for the woman to stay?\n\nMy point also is that despite all her wonderful qualities and seeing her as an \"11\", she probably wouldn't be w him unless he is just as wonderful in his own unique ways and he is due credit for that. \n\nAs a SB, I love hearing stories like this. I hear and see way too many stories of men being cheap and stingy and trying to get as much as possible for as little as possible, all while taking the woman's value in his life for granted. This wasn't that. It is nice to see a story like this. I wish them much success.",

Though it\u2019s a bit different from the kind you see in the west.  Either way those were some of my best years (I was mid 30s) of growth and fun.  I don\u2019t know any black men who live in China or Asia now that actually want to go back to the US.  So yes racism is there (it\u2019s literally everywhere) but it isn\u2019t that bad.

Chinese parents expect their children to have babies so they have grandchildren to raise.

Foreigners as husbands or wives is seen as a direct threat to that dynamic, and usually sparks a lot of fear from the family.\n\nFor sure though, colorism is a problem throughout Asia, even amongst others in their own country.",
