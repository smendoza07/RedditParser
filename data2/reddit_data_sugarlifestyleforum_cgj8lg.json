    "body": "Example of the hairstyle I had: https://imgur.com/hCMuYxH\n\nYesterday night my friend and I went to this really nice rooftop bar to freestyle together. A man struck up a conversation with me and it was going great until we were talking about careers and he said \u201cyour hairstyle is ghetto and it should be more professional\u201d.\n\nNow I live in an area where during summer it gets hot and I don\u2019t want to deal with my natural hair as it\u2019s very hard to deal with (4c curls) and tends to break easily if I don\u2019t protect it hence the braids.\n\nI wasn\u2019t upset b/c I was confident enough to know I\u2019m fine either way but sometimes ignorance catches me off guard. I\u2019m glad he showed his true colors early on.",

I've been racist, held racist thoughts, said racist things.

I can make assumptions based on your argument and attitude, but we're 2 anonymous dudes on the internet. \n\nHowever, if even for the sake of argument, I'm going to assume you're a white guy who grew up around mostly white people and most of your conversations about race and racism were with other white people. I make that assumption because that is my own experience. And I've heard this defensiveness about the racist label for most of my life.\n\nI think the bigger issue is that most white people are more concerned with being labeled a racist, than they are about the effects of actual racism on people of color. I think the first step is acknowledging our own racism, whether it comes from ignorance, prejudice, stereotyping, fear, or even hate. Own it and take responsibility for it. Trust me, it will feel better than defending random assholes on the internet who you don't know instead of offering sympathy for the OP.",
