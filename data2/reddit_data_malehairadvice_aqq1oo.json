I comb my hair into the shape I want after towel drying, I use a thick bristle brush to flatten the sides. I brush my teeth, get dressed, then come back and use my hair dryer. I dry the side down flat first, with a concentrator. Then I bend over and dry the top while my head is upside down to get some body into the hair, before its dry I stand back up and blow dry it while brushing it into the shape I want with my hands or a small roller brush. After its done my hair is pretty much in this exact shape but without product. I sprinkle in my powder, run my hands through for shape and hold, then apply a small amount of product to my sides to keep them down. Thats it!",

I comb my hair into the shape I want after towel drying, I use a thick bristle brush to flatten the sides. I brush my teeth, get dressed, then come back and use my hair dryer. I dry the side down flat first, with a concentrator. Then I bend over and dry the top while my head is upside down to get some body into the hair, before its dry I stand back up and blow dry it while brushing it into the shape I want with my hands or a small roller brush. After its done my hair is pretty much in this exact shape but without product. I sprinkle in my powder, run my hands through for shape and hold, then apply a small amount of product to my sides to keep them down. Thats it!",
