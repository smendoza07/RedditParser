In the mission, the guy he's facing goes on about how the world is different, and how it was *NARUTO* that changed everything, and made it worse. That now, the world revolved around money, and how money was power. And Naruto couldn't comprehend it fully. It was sorta like the pain speech, but it was more back and forth. It should've been animated and boruto should've been more about Naruto dealing with the political aspects of the world and facing the issue of money being everything, while trying to maintain his idea of peace, and being a new parent and newly wed. Your idea of having borutos generation be super smart and fixing the holes in Narutos peaceful world isn't bad, but it wouldn't work. It'd be impossible. And Honesty a little disrespectful. Having Naruto accept that the world has changed, and that he should just live his own life with his new family would be better, because honestly the Naruto we got in boruto is kinda bad. If he had build up to be the depressed man we see In early boruto (Im talking anime as an anime only) then it would've been way better",

Just that in this more peaceful age, a more interesting talent would have a focus on politics than combat. There are infinite fires to put out and finite people to fight them. The greater cooperation would make the villages less readily responsive as well. So while the gokage work together and put out the big fires, boruto and co deal with things (beyond their reasonable position and clearance) that threaten individual villages and kages\u2019 positions. Things like quelling unrest, uncovering conspiracies, and deradicalizing movements. All the things naruto\u2019s generation has too many eyes on them to deal with effectively.\n\nTo;dr I was not suggesting boruto run around fixing every one of the parents\u2019 problems, just the threadbare patches that tend to go overlooked(like amegakure)",

It wasn't good and was honestly TRASH! But everything you described is basically Sasukes job. Even amegakure, which would actually be a kages job, and in the kages power to help. Given they have the permission of the lord in charge of it. Its a more political matter, that boruto and his group wouldn't deal with. The anime has tried out most of your ideas and they flopped pretty badly, not gonna lie. \n\nSomething you mentioned was that they wouldn't have clearance, and that brings the whole idea down, because if they did, they'd be rouges and would end up un jail or dead. Since they are the kids of the most well known people in the entire world, they'd be in jail for a while. It honestly sounds like a decent idea, but the more thought you put into it it sounds like a bad childish version of batman. Maybe batman isn't the best example, but that's honestly the vibes I'm getting from it",

Sadly I can't have it since it was my 3rd anime after Naruto and Naruto shipuden and everyone was saying it's amazing and top tier, so I watched and was disappointed. Didn't like the story, the art was really bad and too vibrant but I actually didn't mind that part because it was a sign that it was a time of peace and boruto was enjoying the life Naruto gave, and early Naruto was similar. It was bright and cheery while Naruto enjoyed his life and didn't care much about anything. It was the voice acting that struck me hard at first as a dub watcher so I switched to sub but it wasn't much better, so I went back to dub. The next thing was the character design. Specifically for boruto. But I was willing to let that slide. But as I watched more, and the story got progressively more boring and uninteresting, I was starting to see more problems and lose interest. I kept watching because I felt like I had to, but the bad plot that didn't seem to ever connect, episodes feeling incomplete (Specifically episode 11 with the whole sumire thing) characters being bland and the original cast being dog shit besides shino, the main character being unlikable and honestly in debates of being one of the most annoying characters in the entire franchise with part 1 Sakura and early konohamaru, the whole deal with sarada and borutos connection, like it honestly feels like a fanfiction version of Naruto and Sasuke (fuck NaruSasu), and them bringing back things from Naruto and some how making them worse and cringey like they belong on tic toc (new 7 ninja swordsman im looking at you) all combined to make a bad show. I got to episode 150 and stopped. And before anyone tells me I should've continued, episode 151 was the newest episode and I started it, but fell asleep during it and didn't feel like waiting a week to feel disappointed so I dropped boruto. I dropped anime as a whole until my friend convinced me to watch bleach episode 315 14 minutes in, when ichigo grabs aizen and throws him in a mountain. I got back into anime and realized that boruto was just bad, and people were overhyping it. \n\nWhat really sold the anime as shit for me though was how people talked about the manga. The first 10 chapters and we already have an actual story with characters we want to follow. Out of 10 chapters, only 3 of them got adapted and it took 60 episodes and ended up being turned into a movie which was better then the arc in the anime. Those other 7 arcs didn't get animated till like months after I've dropped boruto.",

And there's certainly discussion to be had, I just think it's childish to hate on people who liked it. Personally I talked with a friend of mine a few months ago and his position was that despite the flaws he could still enjoy the anime, I think that's a perfectly fine position to take. Now when people deny the problems it starts to get tricky, specially with how subjective all this stuff is. \n\nWell, this hasn't been a very well structured argument but basically what I want to say is that there can be discussion about the problems (or lack thereof) in Boruto, but that liking or not liking it is ultimately a personal decision and it's not fair to judge someone solely for liking (or disliking) Boruto.",

It\u2019s all the filler that is shit. Literally episodes centered around Cho Cho are ducking unbearable. But once they got around to introducing Kara it started getting really fucking good. I\u2019m super into it now. So much so that I picked up the manga and started reading where the anime left off so now I\u2019m doomed to wait a month for a new chapter \ud83d\ude1e but at least I get to watch an animated episode of what I read once a week. \n\nOne thing I\u2019ll say that I like about Boruto compared to Naruto, and I\u2019ve said this before maybe even here, is that the enemy/villain is clearly identified. None of that shit where there are 20 different puppet masters who are each pulling the strings of the other. It always felt rushed & poorly thought out too. No wait it\u2019s not Pain it\u2019s Toby; no wait it\u2019s not Toby it\u2019s Madara because Toby IS Madara; no wait Toby is actually Obito but Madara is still the enemy okay cool; No wait it\u2019s Kaguya!!! \ud83d\ude31\n\nI think we can all agree the war arc was a mess and I personally would have preferred Kishimoto to put the series on hold to flesh out the fucking story instead flying by the seat of his pants that whole arc. The Pain Arc was beautiful but after that it got rough.\n\nA lot of people are upset with Boruto because of the otsusuki power scaling but it\u2019s gravitating more and more towards requiring them to have to fight more strategically to win which makes it more interesting IME vs a bunch of tailed beast bombs & shit. If like the first 150 episodes of Boruto had 50% less filler it would be an incredible series. I don\u2019t like to compare the two because they are supposed to be different obviously. I find the Otsusuki lore & the karma interesting. Oh & a lot of people get so pissed off at Boruto in the beginning because he hates his dad & because Naruto acts like a shit father too. I\u2019ll admit that brat Boruto made me wanna quit watching but once they kiss and make up Boruto stops being a brat.",

I hear the new Kara arc and story with kawaki are good and we are FINALLY ADAPTING MANGA STORY INTO THE ANIME and its all been pretty good, but I can't call it a good anime because of the over 150 episodes of trash we got. If that didn't happen, and boruto was a seasonal anime so that the manga could produce content for the anime to adapt instead of giving us shit, I probally would've liked boruto, and the series as a whole would've been good. But 20 episodes out of 215 don't make a good series. \n\nI agree with the war arc thing though. I liked the war arc. It was interesting, and madara was being built up for the whole series and Toby being a main villain was also built up and slowly hinted in his early interactions. I personally never thought the akasuki themselves would be the biggest threat in Naruto, since they seemed pretty weak with narutos progression, and them already defeating a few of them early on, but the thing with kaguya did feel rushed and the war arc, while super enjoyable including the filler, it wasn't good structurally. Still had some emotional moments and bad ass ones though and I loved it.",

Surely they had the foresight to know the scrutiny it would be under and the amount of fans they\u2019ve missed out on because of the excessive fillers. Honestly I feel like they should have waited till about now to start airing the anime if they wanted it weekly. But perhaps they\u2019ve been making enough money to where it doesn\u2019t fucking matter which is a shame because it clearly means it\u2019s a cash grab but oh well I\u2019m just gonna keep enjoying Boruto now that it\u2019s gotten good and I endured the hellacious gambit of fillers lol",

In the mission, the guy he's facing goes on about how the world is different, and how it was *NARUTO* that changed everything, and made it worse. That now, the world revolved around money, and how money was power. And Naruto couldn't comprehend it fully. It was sorta like the pain speech, but it was more back and forth. It should've been animated and boruto should've been more about Naruto dealing with the political aspects of the world and facing the issue of money being everything, while trying to maintain his idea of peace, and being a new parent and newly wed. Your idea of having borutos generation be super smart and fixing the holes in Narutos peaceful world isn't bad, but it wouldn't work. It'd be impossible. And Honesty a little disrespectful. Having Naruto accept that the world has changed, and that he should just live his own life with his new family would be better, because honestly the Naruto we got in boruto is kinda bad. If he had build up to be the depressed man we see In early boruto (Im talking anime as an anime only) then it would've been way better",

Just that in this more peaceful age, a more interesting talent would have a focus on politics than combat. There are infinite fires to put out and finite people to fight them. The greater cooperation would make the villages less readily responsive as well. So while the gokage work together and put out the big fires, boruto and co deal with things (beyond their reasonable position and clearance) that threaten individual villages and kages\u2019 positions. Things like quelling unrest, uncovering conspiracies, and deradicalizing movements. All the things naruto\u2019s generation has too many eyes on them to deal with effectively.\n\nTo;dr I was not suggesting boruto run around fixing every one of the parents\u2019 problems, just the threadbare patches that tend to go overlooked(like amegakure)",

Not to a large extent, but after you explaining and giving examples I still have to give it a no. Something similar happened In the anime already. It was the sumire thing. It wasn't good and was honestly TRASH! But everything you described is basically Sasukes job. Even amegakure, which would actually be a kages job, and in the kages power to help. Given they have the permission of the lord in charge of it. Its a more political matter, that boruto and his group wouldn't deal with. The anime has tried out most of your ideas and they flopped pretty badly, not gonna lie. \n\nSomething you mentioned was that they wouldn't have clearance, and that brings the whole idea down, because if they did, they'd be rouges and would end up un jail or dead. Since they are the kids of the most well known people in the entire world, they'd be in jail for a while. It honestly sounds like a decent idea, but the more thought you put into it it sounds like a bad childish version of batman. Maybe batman isn't the best example, but that's honestly the vibes I'm getting from it",

Sadly I can't have it since it was my 3rd anime after Naruto and Naruto shipuden and everyone was saying it's amazing and top tier, so I watched and was disappointed. Didn't like the story, the art was really bad and too vibrant but I actually didn't mind that part because it was a sign that it was a time of peace and boruto was enjoying the life Naruto gave, and early Naruto was similar. It was bright and cheery while Naruto enjoyed his life and didn't care much about anything. It was the voice acting that struck me hard at first as a dub watcher so I switched to sub but it wasn't much better, so I went back to dub. The next thing was the character design. Specifically for boruto. But I was willing to let that slide. But as I watched more, and the story got progressively more boring and uninteresting, I was starting to see more problems and lose interest. I kept watching because I felt like I had to, but the bad plot that didn't seem to ever connect, episodes feeling incomplete (Specifically episode 11 with the whole sumire thing) characters being bland and the original cast being dog shit besides shino, the main character being unlikable and honestly in debates of being one of the most annoying characters in the entire franchise with part 1 Sakura and early konohamaru, the whole deal with sarada and borutos connection, like it honestly feels like a fanfiction version of Naruto and Sasuke (fuck NaruSasu), and them bringing back things from Naruto and some how making them worse and cringey like they belong on tic toc (new 7 ninja swordsman im looking at you) all combined to make a bad show. I got to episode 150 and stopped. And before anyone tells me I should've continued, episode 151 was the newest episode and I started it, but fell asleep during it and didn't feel like waiting a week to feel disappointed so I dropped boruto. I dropped anime as a whole until my friend convinced me to watch bleach episode 315 14 minutes in, when ichigo grabs aizen and throws him in a mountain. I got back into anime and realized that boruto was just bad, and people were overhyping it. \n\nWhat really sold the anime as shit for me though was how people talked about the manga. The first 10 chapters and we already have an actual story with characters we want to follow. Out of 10 chapters, only 3 of them got adapted and it took 60 episodes and ended up being turned into a movie which was better then the arc in the anime. Those other 7 arcs didn't get animated till like months after I've dropped boruto.",

And there's certainly discussion to be had, I just think it's childish to hate on people who liked it. Personally I talked with a friend of mine a few months ago and his position was that despite the flaws he could still enjoy the anime, I think that's a perfectly fine position to take. Now when people deny the problems it starts to get tricky, specially with how subjective all this stuff is. \n\nWell, this hasn't been a very well structured argument but basically what I want to say is that there can be discussion about the problems (or lack thereof) in Boruto, but that liking or not liking it is ultimately a personal decision and it's not fair to judge someone solely for liking (or disliking) Boruto.",

It\u2019s all the filler that is shit. Literally episodes centered around Cho Cho are ducking unbearable. But once they got around to introducing Kara it started getting really fucking good. I\u2019m super into it now. So much so that I picked up the manga and started reading where the anime left off so now I\u2019m doomed to wait a month for a new chapter \ud83d\ude1e but at least I get to watch an animated episode of what I read once a week. \n\nOne thing I\u2019ll say that I like about Boruto compared to Naruto, and I\u2019ve said this before maybe even here, is that the enemy/villain is clearly identified. None of that shit where there are 20 different puppet masters who are each pulling the strings of the other. It always felt rushed & poorly thought out too. No wait it\u2019s not Pain it\u2019s Toby; no wait it\u2019s not Toby it\u2019s Madara because Toby IS Madara; no wait Toby is actually Obito but Madara is still the enemy okay cool; No wait it\u2019s Kaguya!!! \ud83d\ude31\n\nI think we can all agree the war arc was a mess and I personally would have preferred Kishimoto to put the series on hold to flesh out the fucking story instead flying by the seat of his pants that whole arc. The Pain Arc was beautiful but after that it got rough.\n\nA lot of people are upset with Boruto because of the otsusuki power scaling but it\u2019s gravitating more and more towards requiring them to have to fight more strategically to win which makes it more interesting IME vs a bunch of tailed beast bombs & shit. If like the first 150 episodes of Boruto had 50% less filler it would be an incredible series. I don\u2019t like to compare the two because they are supposed to be different obviously. I find the Otsusuki lore & the karma interesting. Oh & a lot of people get so pissed off at Boruto in the beginning because he hates his dad & because Naruto acts like a shit father too. I\u2019ll admit that brat Boruto made me wanna quit watching but once they kiss and make up Boruto stops being a brat.",

I hear the new Kara arc and story with kawaki are good and we are FINALLY ADAPTING MANGA STORY INTO THE ANIME and its all been pretty good, but I can't call it a good anime because of the over 150 episodes of trash we got. If that didn't happen, and boruto was a seasonal anime so that the manga could produce content for the anime to adapt instead of giving us shit, I probally would've liked boruto, and the series as a whole would've been good. But 20 episodes out of 215 don't make a good series. \n\nI agree with the war arc thing though. I liked the war arc. It was interesting, and madara was being built up for the whole series and Toby being a main villain was also built up and slowly hinted in his early interactions. I personally never thought the akasuki themselves would be the biggest threat in Naruto, since they seemed pretty weak with narutos progression, and them already defeating a few of them early on, but the thing with kaguya did feel rushed and the war arc, while super enjoyable including the filler, it wasn't good structurally. Still had some emotional moments and bad ass ones though and I loved it.",

Boruto could have been fucking great if they basically made it seasonal like you said. Surely they had the foresight to know the scrutiny it would be under and the amount of fans they\u2019ve missed out on because of the excessive fillers. Honestly I feel like they should have waited till about now to start airing the anime if they wanted it weekly. But perhaps they\u2019ve been making enough money to where it doesn\u2019t fucking matter which is a shame because it clearly means it\u2019s a cash grab but oh well I\u2019m just gonna keep enjoying Boruto now that it\u2019s gotten good and I endured the hellacious gambit of fillers lol",

In the mission, the guy he's facing goes on about how the world is different, and how it was *NARUTO* that changed everything, and made it worse. That now, the world revolved around money, and how money was power. And Naruto couldn't comprehend it fully. It was sorta like the pain speech, but it was more back and forth. It should've been animated and boruto should've been more about Naruto dealing with the political aspects of the world and facing the issue of money being everything, while trying to maintain his idea of peace, and being a new parent and newly wed. Your idea of having borutos generation be super smart and fixing the holes in Narutos peaceful world isn't bad, but it wouldn't work. It'd be impossible. And Honesty a little disrespectful. Having Naruto accept that the world has changed, and that he should just live his own life with his new family would be better, because honestly the Naruto we got in boruto is kinda bad. If he had build up to be the depressed man we see In early boruto (Im talking anime as an anime only) then it would've been way better",

Just that in this more peaceful age, a more interesting talent would have a focus on politics than combat. There are infinite fires to put out and finite people to fight them. The greater cooperation would make the villages less readily responsive as well. So while the gokage work together and put out the big fires, boruto and co deal with things (beyond their reasonable position and clearance) that threaten individual villages and kages\u2019 positions. Things like quelling unrest, uncovering conspiracies, and deradicalizing movements. All the things naruto\u2019s generation has too many eyes on them to deal with effectively.\n\nTo;dr I was not suggesting boruto run around fixing every one of the parents\u2019 problems, just the threadbare patches that tend to go overlooked(like amegakure)",

Not to a large extent, but after you explaining and giving examples I still have to give it a no. Something similar happened In the anime already. It was the sumire thing. It wasn't good and was honestly TRASH! But everything you described is basically Sasukes job. Even amegakure, which would actually be a kages job, and in the kages power to help. Given they have the permission of the lord in charge of it. Its a more political matter, that boruto and his group wouldn't deal with. The anime has tried out most of your ideas and they flopped pretty badly, not gonna lie. \n\nSomething you mentioned was that they wouldn't have clearance, and that brings the whole idea down, because if they did, they'd be rouges and would end up un jail or dead. Since they are the kids of the most well known people in the entire world, they'd be in jail for a while. It honestly sounds like a decent idea, but the more thought you put into it it sounds like a bad childish version of batman. Maybe batman isn't the best example, but that's honestly the vibes I'm getting from it",

But since they were injured so badly, the humans have more time, and they slowly fight for control. It would be awesome, because their personalities wouldn't mesh. Momoshiki, a cold, emotionless conqueror, battles Boruto, a headstrong young prodigy. Kinshiki, a berserker, battles the cool, calculated Sarada. Urashiki and Mitsuki just start syncing perfectly right off the bat.\n\nMost of all, I just want it to be way darker. I want to see them beaten and broken.

                                            "body": "That's the right mindset to have when in relation to boruto. Sadly I can't have it since it was my 3rd anime after Naruto and Naruto shipuden and everyone was saying it's amazing and top tier, so I watched and was disappointed. Didn't like the story, the art was really bad and too vibrant but I actually didn't mind that part because it was a sign that it was a time of peace and boruto was enjoying the life Naruto gave, and early Naruto was similar. It was bright and cheery while Naruto enjoyed his life and didn't care much about anything. It was the voice acting that struck me hard at first as a dub watcher so I switched to sub but it wasn't much better, so I went back to dub. The next thing was the character design. Specifically for boruto. But I was willing to let that slide. But as I watched more, and the story got progressively more boring and uninteresting, I was starting to see more problems and lose interest. I kept watching because I felt like I had to, but the bad plot that didn't seem to ever connect, episodes feeling incomplete (Specifically episode 11 with the whole sumire thing) characters being bland and the original cast being dog shit besides shino, the main character being unlikable and honestly in debates of being one of the most annoying characters in the entire franchise with part 1 Sakura and early konohamaru, the whole deal with sarada and borutos connection, like it honestly feels like a fanfiction version of Naruto and Sasuke (fuck NaruSasu), and them bringing back things from Naruto and some how making them worse and cringey like they belong on tic toc (new 7 ninja swordsman im looking at you) all combined to make a bad show. I got to episode 150 and stopped. And before anyone tells me I should've continued, episode 151 was the newest episode and I started it, but fell asleep during it and didn't feel like waiting a week to feel disappointed so I dropped boruto. I dropped anime as a whole until my friend convinced me to watch bleach episode 315 14 minutes in, when ichigo grabs aizen and throws him in a mountain. I got back into anime and realized that boruto was just bad, and people were overhyping it. \n\nWhat really sold the anime as shit for me though was how people talked about the manga. The first 10 chapters and we already have an actual story with characters we want to follow. Out of 10 chapters, only 3 of them got adapted and it took 60 episodes and ended up being turned into a movie which was better then the arc in the anime. Those other 7 arcs didn't get animated till like months after I've dropped boruto.",

And there's certainly discussion to be had, I just think it's childish to hate on people who liked it. Personally I talked with a friend of mine a few months ago and his position was that despite the flaws he could still enjoy the anime, I think that's a perfectly fine position to take. Now when people deny the problems it starts to get tricky, specially with how subjective all this stuff is. \n\nWell, this hasn't been a very well structured argument but basically what I want to say is that there can be discussion about the problems (or lack thereof) in Boruto, but that liking or not liking it is ultimately a personal decision and it's not fair to judge someone solely for liking (or disliking) Boruto.",

Literally episodes centered around Cho Cho are ducking unbearable. But once they got around to introducing Kara it started getting really fucking good. I\u2019m super into it now. So much so that I picked up the manga and started reading where the anime left off so now I\u2019m doomed to wait a month for a new chapter \ud83d\ude1e but at least I get to watch an animated episode of what I read once a week. \n\nOne thing I\u2019ll say that I like about Boruto compared to Naruto, and I\u2019ve said this before maybe even here, is that the enemy/villain is clearly identified. None of that shit where there are 20 different puppet masters who are each pulling the strings of the other. It always felt rushed & poorly thought out too. No wait it\u2019s not Pain it\u2019s Toby; no wait it\u2019s not Toby it\u2019s Madara because Toby IS Madara; no wait Toby is actually Obito but Madara is still the enemy okay cool; No wait it\u2019s Kaguya!!! \ud83d\ude31\n\nI think we can all agree the war arc was a mess and I personally would have preferred Kishimoto to put the series on hold to flesh out the fucking story instead flying by the seat of his pants that whole arc. The Pain Arc was beautiful but after that it got rough.\n\nA lot of people are upset with Boruto because of the otsusuki power scaling but it\u2019s gravitating more and more towards requiring them to have to fight more strategically to win which makes it more interesting IME vs a bunch of tailed beast bombs & shit. If like the first 150 episodes of Boruto had 50% less filler it would be an incredible series. I don\u2019t like to compare the two because they are supposed to be different obviously. I find the Otsusuki lore & the karma interesting. Oh & a lot of people get so pissed off at Boruto in the beginning because he hates his dad & because Naruto acts like a shit father too. I\u2019ll admit that brat Boruto made me wanna quit watching but once they kiss and make up Boruto stops being a brat.",

I hear the new Kara arc and story with kawaki are good and we are FINALLY ADAPTING MANGA STORY INTO THE ANIME and its all been pretty good, but I can't call it a good anime because of the over 150 episodes of trash we got. If that didn't happen, and boruto was a seasonal anime so that the manga could produce content for the anime to adapt instead of giving us shit, I probally would've liked boruto, and the series as a whole would've been good. But 20 episodes out of 215 don't make a good series. \n\nI agree with the war arc thing though. I liked the war arc. It was interesting, and madara was being built up for the whole series and Toby being a main villain was also built up and slowly hinted in his early interactions. I personally never thought the akasuki themselves would be the biggest threat in Naruto, since they seemed pretty weak with narutos progression, and them already defeating a few of them early on, but the thing with kaguya did feel rushed and the war arc, while super enjoyable including the filler, it wasn't good structurally. Still had some emotional moments and bad ass ones though and I loved it.",

Boruto could have been fucking great if they basically made it seasonal like you said. Surely they had the foresight to know the scrutiny it would be under and the amount of fans they\u2019ve missed out on because of the excessive fillers. Honestly I feel like they should have waited till about now to start airing the anime if they wanted it weekly. But perhaps they\u2019ve been making enough money to where it doesn\u2019t fucking matter which is a shame because it clearly means it\u2019s a cash grab but oh well I\u2019m just gonna keep enjoying Boruto now that it\u2019s gotten good and I endured the hellacious gambit of fillers lol",

That now, the world revolved around money, and how money was power. And Naruto couldn't comprehend it fully. It was sorta like the pain speech, but it was more back and forth. It should've been animated and boruto should've been more about Naruto dealing with the political aspects of the world and facing the issue of money being everything, while trying to maintain his idea of peace, and being a new parent and newly wed. Your idea of having borutos generation be super smart and fixing the holes in Narutos peaceful world isn't bad, but it wouldn't work. It'd be impossible. And Honesty a little disrespectful. Having Naruto accept that the world has changed, and that he should just live his own life with his new family would be better, because honestly the Naruto we got in boruto is kinda bad. If he had build up to be the depressed man we see In early boruto (Im talking anime as an anime only) then it would've been way better",

Just that in this more peaceful age, a more interesting talent would have a focus on politics than combat. There are infinite fires to put out and finite people to fight them. The greater cooperation would make the villages less readily responsive as well. So while the gokage work together and put out the big fires, boruto and co deal with things (beyond their reasonable position and clearance) that threaten individual villages and kages\u2019 positions. Things like quelling unrest, uncovering conspiracies, and deradicalizing movements. All the things naruto\u2019s generation has too many eyes on them to deal with effectively.\n\nTo;dr I was not suggesting boruto run around fixing every one of the parents\u2019 problems, just the threadbare patches that tend to go overlooked(like amegakure)",

Even amegakure, which would actually be a kages job, and in the kages power to help. Given they have the permission of the lord in charge of it. Its a more political matter, that boruto and his group wouldn't deal with. The anime has tried out most of your ideas and they flopped pretty badly, not gonna lie. \n\nSomething you mentioned was that they wouldn't have clearance, and that brings the whole idea down, because if they did, they'd be rouges and would end up un jail or dead. Since they are the kids of the most well known people in the entire world, they'd be in jail for a while. It honestly sounds like a decent idea, but the more thought you put into it it sounds like a bad childish version of batman.

Sadly I can't have it since it was my 3rd anime after Naruto and Naruto shipuden and everyone was saying it's amazing and top tier, so I watched and was disappointed. Didn't like the story, the art was really bad and too vibrant but I actually didn't mind that part because it was a sign that it was a time of peace and boruto was enjoying the life Naruto gave, and early Naruto was similar. It was bright and cheery while Naruto enjoyed his life and didn't care much about anything. It was the voice acting that struck me hard at first as a dub watcher so I switched to sub but it wasn't much better, so I went back to dub. The next thing was the character design. Specifically for boruto. But I was willing to let that slide. But as I watched more, and the story got progressively more boring and uninteresting, I was starting to see more problems and lose interest. I kept watching because I felt like I had to, but the bad plot that didn't seem to ever connect, episodes feeling incomplete (Specifically episode 11 with the whole sumire thing) characters being bland and the original cast being dog shit besides shino, the main character being unlikable and honestly in debates of being one of the most annoying characters in the entire franchise with part 1 Sakura and early konohamaru, the whole deal with sarada and borutos connection, like it honestly feels like a fanfiction version of Naruto and Sasuke (fuck NaruSasu), and them bringing back things from Naruto and some how making them worse and cringey like they belong on tic toc (new 7 ninja swordsman im looking at you) all combined to make a bad show. I got to episode 150 and stopped. And before anyone tells me I should've continued, episode 151 was the newest episode and I started it, but fell asleep during it and didn't feel like waiting a week to feel disappointed so I dropped boruto. I dropped anime as a whole until my friend convinced me to watch bleach episode 315 14 minutes in, when ichigo grabs aizen and throws him in a mountain. I got back into anime and realized that boruto was just bad, and people were overhyping it. \n\nWhat really sold the anime as shit for me though was how people talked about the manga. The first 10 chapters and we already have an actual story with characters we want to follow. Out of 10 chapters, only 3 of them got adapted and it took 60 episodes and ended up being turned into a movie which was better then the arc in the anime. Those other 7 arcs didn't get animated till like months after I've dropped boruto.",

And there's certainly discussion to be had, I just think it's childish to hate on people who liked it. Personally I talked with a friend of mine a few months ago and his position was that despite the flaws he could still enjoy the anime, I think that's a perfectly fine position to take. Now when people deny the problems it starts to get tricky, specially with how subjective all this stuff is. \n\nWell, this hasn't been a very well structured argument but basically what I want to say is that there can be discussion about the problems (or lack thereof) in Boruto, but that liking or not liking it is ultimately a personal decision and it's not fair to judge someone solely for liking (or disliking) Boruto.",

Literally episodes centered around Cho Cho are ducking unbearable. But once they got around to introducing Kara it started getting really fucking good. I\u2019m super into it now. So much so that I picked up the manga and started reading where the anime left off so now I\u2019m doomed to wait a month for a new chapter \ud83d\ude1e but at least I get to watch an animated episode of what I read once a week. \n\nOne thing I\u2019ll say that I like about Boruto compared to Naruto, and I\u2019ve said this before maybe even here, is that the enemy/villain is clearly identified. None of that shit where there are 20 different puppet masters who are each pulling the strings of the other. It always felt rushed & poorly thought out too. No wait it\u2019s not Pain it\u2019s Toby; no wait it\u2019s not Toby it\u2019s Madara because Toby IS Madara; no wait Toby is actually Obito but Madara is still the enemy okay cool; No wait it\u2019s Kaguya!!! \ud83d\ude31\n\nI think we can all agree the war arc was a mess and I personally would have preferred Kishimoto to put the series on hold to flesh out the fucking story instead flying by the seat of his pants that whole arc. The Pain Arc was beautiful but after that it got rough.\n\nA lot of people are upset with Boruto because of the otsusuki power scaling but it\u2019s gravitating more and more towards requiring them to have to fight more strategically to win which makes it more interesting IME vs a bunch of tailed beast bombs & shit. If like the first 150 episodes of Boruto had 50% less filler it would be an incredible series. I don\u2019t like to compare the two because they are supposed to be different obviously. I find the Otsusuki lore & the karma interesting. Oh & a lot of people get so pissed off at Boruto in the beginning because he hates his dad & because Naruto acts like a shit father too. I\u2019ll admit that brat Boruto made me wanna quit watching but once they kiss and make up Boruto stops being a brat.",

I hear the new Kara arc and story with kawaki are good and we are FINALLY ADAPTING MANGA STORY INTO THE ANIME and its all been pretty good, but I can't call it a good anime because of the over 150 episodes of trash we got. If that didn't happen, and boruto was a seasonal anime so that the manga could produce content for the anime to adapt instead of giving us shit, I probally would've liked boruto, and the series as a whole would've been good. But 20 episodes out of 215 don't make a good series. \n\nI agree with the war arc thing though. I liked the war arc. It was interesting, and madara was being built up for the whole series and Toby being a main villain was also built up and slowly hinted in his early interactions. I personally never thought the akasuki themselves would be the biggest threat in Naruto, since they seemed pretty weak with narutos progression, and them already defeating a few of them early on, but the thing with kaguya did feel rushed and the war arc, while super enjoyable including the filler, it wasn't good structurally. Still had some emotional moments and bad ass ones though and I loved it.",

Surely they had the foresight to know the scrutiny it would be under and the amount of fans they\u2019ve missed out on because of the excessive fillers. Honestly I feel like they should have waited till about now to start airing the anime if they wanted it weekly. But perhaps they\u2019ve been making enough money to where it doesn\u2019t fucking matter which is a shame because it clearly means it\u2019s a cash grab but oh well I\u2019m just gonna keep enjoying Boruto now that it\u2019s gotten good and I endured the hellacious gambit of fillers lol",

In the mission, the guy he's facing goes on about how the world is different, and how it was *NARUTO* that changed everything, and made it worse. That now, the world revolved around money, and how money was power. And Naruto couldn't comprehend it fully. It was sorta like the pain speech, but it was more back and forth. It should've been animated and boruto should've been more about Naruto dealing with the political aspects of the world and facing the issue of money being everything, while trying to maintain his idea of peace, and being a new parent and newly wed. Your idea of having borutos generation be super smart and fixing the holes in Narutos peaceful world isn't bad, but it wouldn't work. It'd be impossible. And Honesty a little disrespectful. Having Naruto accept that the world has changed, and that he should just live his own life with his new family would be better, because honestly the Naruto we got in boruto is kinda bad. If he had build up to be the depressed man we see In early boruto (Im talking anime as an anime only) then it would've been way better",

Just that in this more peaceful age, a more interesting talent would have a focus on politics than combat. There are infinite fires to put out and finite people to fight them. The greater cooperation would make the villages less readily responsive as well. So while the gokage work together and put out the big fires, boruto and co deal with things (beyond their reasonable position and clearance) that threaten individual villages and kages\u2019 positions. Things like quelling unrest, uncovering conspiracies, and deradicalizing movements. All the things naruto\u2019s generation has too many eyes on them to deal with effectively.\n\nTo;dr I was not suggesting boruto run around fixing every one of the parents\u2019 problems, just the threadbare patches that tend to go overlooked(like amegakure)",

Something similar happened In the anime already. It was the sumire thing. It wasn't good and was honestly TRASH! But everything you described is basically Sasukes job. Even amegakure, which would actually be a kages job, and in the kages power to help. Given they have the permission of the lord in charge of it. Its a more political matter, that boruto and his group wouldn't deal with. The anime has tried out most of your ideas and they flopped pretty badly, not gonna lie. \n\nSomething you mentioned was that they wouldn't have clearance, and that brings the whole idea down, because if they did, they'd be rouges and would end up un jail or dead. Since they are the kids of the most well known people in the entire world, they'd be in jail for a while. It honestly sounds like a decent idea, but the more thought you put into it it sounds like a bad childish version of batman. Maybe batman isn't the best example, but that's honestly the vibes I'm getting from it",

Sadly I can't have it since it was my 3rd anime after Naruto and Naruto shipuden and everyone was saying it's amazing and top tier, so I watched and was disappointed. Didn't like the story, the art was really bad and too vibrant but I actually didn't mind that part because it was a sign that it was a time of peace and boruto was enjoying the life Naruto gave, and early Naruto was similar. It was bright and cheery while Naruto enjoyed his life and didn't care much about anything. It was the voice acting that struck me hard at first as a dub watcher so I switched to sub but it wasn't much better, so I went back to dub. The next thing was the character design. Specifically for boruto. But I was willing to let that slide. But as I watched more, and the story got progressively more boring and uninteresting, I was starting to see more problems and lose interest. I kept watching because I felt like I had to, but the bad plot that didn't seem to ever connect, episodes feeling incomplete (Specifically episode 11 with the whole sumire thing) characters being bland and the original cast being dog shit besides shino, the main character being unlikable and honestly in debates of being one of the most annoying characters in the entire franchise with part 1 Sakura and early konohamaru, the whole deal with sarada and borutos connection, like it honestly feels like a fanfiction version of Naruto and Sasuke (fuck NaruSasu), and them bringing back things from Naruto and some how making them worse and cringey like they belong on tic toc (new 7 ninja swordsman im looking at you) all combined to make a bad show. I got to episode 150 and stopped. And before anyone tells me I should've continued, episode 151 was the newest episode and I started it, but fell asleep during it and didn't feel like waiting a week to feel disappointed so I dropped boruto. I dropped anime as a whole until my friend convinced me to watch bleach episode 315 14 minutes in, when ichigo grabs aizen and throws him in a mountain. I got back into anime and realized that boruto was just bad, and people were overhyping it. \n\nWhat really sold the anime as shit for me though was how people talked about the manga. The first 10 chapters and we already have an actual story with characters we want to follow. Out of 10 chapters, only 3 of them got adapted and it took 60 episodes and ended up being turned into a movie which was better then the arc in the anime. Those other 7 arcs didn't get animated till like months after I've dropped boruto.",

And there's certainly discussion to be had, I just think it's childish to hate on people who liked it. Personally I talked with a friend of mine a few months ago and his position was that despite the flaws he could still enjoy the anime, I think that's a perfectly fine position to take. Now when people deny the problems it starts to get tricky, specially with how subjective all this stuff is. \n\nWell, this hasn't been a very well structured argument but basically what I want to say is that there can be discussion about the problems (or lack thereof) in Boruto, but that liking or not liking it is ultimately a personal decision and it's not fair to judge someone solely for liking (or disliking) Boruto.",

            "body": "Yeah I actually like Boruto. I\u2019ll admit I stopped watching multiple times but would come back a few months later. It\u2019s all the filler that is shit. Literally episodes centered around Cho Cho are ducking unbearable. But once they got around to introducing Kara it started getting really fucking good. I\u2019m super into it now. So much so that I picked up the manga and started reading where the anime left off so now I\u2019m doomed to wait a month for a new chapter \ud83d\ude1e but at least I get to watch an animated episode of what I read once a week. \n\nOne thing I\u2019ll say that I like about Boruto compared to Naruto, and I\u2019ve said this before maybe even here, is that the enemy/villain is clearly identified. None of that shit where there are 20 different puppet masters who are each pulling the strings of the other. It always felt rushed & poorly thought out too. No wait it\u2019s not Pain it\u2019s Toby; no wait it\u2019s not Toby it\u2019s Madara because Toby IS Madara; no wait Toby is actually Obito but Madara is still the enemy okay cool; No wait it\u2019s Kaguya!!! \ud83d\ude31\n\nI think we can all agree the war arc was a mess and I personally would have preferred Kishimoto to put the series on hold to flesh out the fucking story instead flying by the seat of his pants that whole arc. The Pain Arc was beautiful but after that it got rough.\n\nA lot of people are upset with Boruto because of the otsusuki power scaling but it\u2019s gravitating more and more towards requiring them to have to fight more strategically to win which makes it more interesting IME vs a bunch of tailed beast bombs & shit. If like the first 150 episodes of Boruto had 50% less filler it would be an incredible series. I don\u2019t like to compare the two because they are supposed to be different obviously. I find the Otsusuki lore & the karma interesting. Oh & a lot of people get so pissed off at Boruto in the beginning because he hates his dad & because Naruto acts like a shit father too. I\u2019ll admit that brat Boruto made me wanna quit watching but once they kiss and make up Boruto stops being a brat.",

I hear the new Kara arc and story with kawaki are good and we are FINALLY ADAPTING MANGA STORY INTO THE ANIME and its all been pretty good, but I can't call it a good anime because of the over 150 episodes of trash we got. If that didn't happen, and boruto was a seasonal anime so that the manga could produce content for the anime to adapt instead of giving us shit, I probally would've liked boruto, and the series as a whole would've been good. But 20 episodes out of 215 don't make a good series. \n\nI agree with the war arc thing though. I liked the war arc. It was interesting, and madara was being built up for the whole series and Toby being a main villain was also built up and slowly hinted in his early interactions. I personally never thought the akasuki themselves would be the biggest threat in Naruto, since they seemed pretty weak with narutos progression, and them already defeating a few of them early on, but the thing with kaguya did feel rushed and the war arc, while super enjoyable including the filler, it wasn't good structurally. Still had some emotional moments and bad ass ones though and I loved it.",

Boruto could have been fucking great if they basically made it seasonal like you said. Surely they had the foresight to know the scrutiny it would be under and the amount of fans they\u2019ve missed out on because of the excessive fillers. Honestly I feel like they should have waited till about now to start airing the anime if they wanted it weekly. But perhaps they\u2019ve been making enough money to where it doesn\u2019t fucking matter which is a shame because it clearly means it\u2019s a cash grab but oh well I\u2019m just gonna keep enjoying Boruto now that it\u2019s gotten good and I endured the hellacious gambit of fillers lol",

In the mission, the guy he's facing goes on about how the world is different, and how it was *NARUTO* that changed everything, and made it worse. That now, the world revolved around money, and how money was power. And Naruto couldn't comprehend it fully. It was sorta like the pain speech, but it was more back and forth. It should've been animated and boruto should've been more about Naruto dealing with the political aspects of the world and facing the issue of money being everything, while trying to maintain his idea of peace, and being a new parent and newly wed. Your idea of having borutos generation be super smart and fixing the holes in Narutos peaceful world isn't bad, but it wouldn't work. It'd be impossible. And Honesty a little disrespectful. Having Naruto accept that the world has changed, and that he should just live his own life with his new family would be better, because honestly the Naruto we got in boruto is kinda bad. If he had build up to be the depressed man we see In early boruto (Im talking anime as an anime only) then it would've been way better",

Just that in this more peaceful age, a more interesting talent would have a focus on politics than combat. There are infinite fires to put out and finite people to fight them. The greater cooperation would make the villages less readily responsive as well. So while the gokage work together and put out the big fires, boruto and co deal with things (beyond their reasonable position and clearance) that threaten individual villages and kages\u2019 positions. Things like quelling unrest, uncovering conspiracies, and deradicalizing movements. All the things naruto\u2019s generation has too many eyes on them to deal with effectively.\n\nTo;dr I was not suggesting boruto run around fixing every one of the parents\u2019 problems, just the threadbare patches that tend to go overlooked(like amegakure)",

Something similar happened In the anime already. It was the sumire thing. It wasn't good and was honestly TRASH! But everything you described is basically Sasukes job. Even amegakure, which would actually be a kages job, and in the kages power to help. Given they have the permission of the lord in charge of it. Its a more political matter, that boruto and his group wouldn't deal with. The anime has tried out most of your ideas and they flopped pretty badly, not gonna lie. \n\nSomething you mentioned was that they wouldn't have clearance, and that brings the whole idea down, because if they did, they'd be rouges and would end up un jail or dead. Since they are the kids of the most well known people in the entire world, they'd be in jail for a while. It honestly sounds like a decent idea, but the more thought you put into it it sounds like a bad childish version of batman. Maybe batman isn't the best example, but that's honestly the vibes I'm getting from it",

Sadly I can't have it since it was my 3rd anime after Naruto and Naruto shipuden and everyone was saying it's amazing and top tier, so I watched and was disappointed. Didn't like the story, the art was really bad and too vibrant but I actually didn't mind that part because it was a sign that it was a time of peace and boruto was enjoying the life Naruto gave, and early Naruto was similar. It was bright and cheery while Naruto enjoyed his life and didn't care much about anything. It was the voice acting that struck me hard at first as a dub watcher so I switched to sub but it wasn't much better, so I went back to dub. The next thing was the character design. Specifically for boruto. But I was willing to let that slide. But as I watched more, and the story got progressively more boring and uninteresting, I was starting to see more problems and lose interest. I kept watching because I felt like I had to, but the bad plot that didn't seem to ever connect, episodes feeling incomplete (Specifically episode 11 with the whole sumire thing) characters being bland and the original cast being dog shit besides shino, the main character being unlikable and honestly in debates of being one of the most annoying characters in the entire franchise with part 1 Sakura and early konohamaru, the whole deal with sarada and borutos connection, like it honestly feels like a fanfiction version of Naruto and Sasuke (fuck NaruSasu), and them bringing back things from Naruto and some how making them worse and cringey like they belong on tic toc (new 7 ninja swordsman im looking at you) all combined to make a bad show. I got to episode 150 and stopped. And before anyone tells me I should've continued, episode 151 was the newest episode and I started it, but fell asleep during it and didn't feel like waiting a week to feel disappointed so I dropped boruto. I dropped anime as a whole until my friend convinced me to watch bleach episode 315 14 minutes in, when ichigo grabs aizen and throws him in a mountain. I got back into anime and realized that boruto was just bad, and people were overhyping it. \n\nWhat really sold the anime as shit for me though was how people talked about the manga. The first 10 chapters and we already have an actual story with characters we want to follow. Out of 10 chapters, only 3 of them got adapted and it took 60 episodes and ended up being turned into a movie which was better then the arc in the anime. Those other 7 arcs didn't get animated till like months after I've dropped boruto.",

And there's certainly discussion to be had, I just think it's childish to hate on people who liked it. Personally I talked with a friend of mine a few months ago and his position was that despite the flaws he could still enjoy the anime, I think that's a perfectly fine position to take. Now when people deny the problems it starts to get tricky, specially with how subjective all this stuff is. \n\nWell, this hasn't been a very well structured argument but basically what I want to say is that there can be discussion about the problems (or lack thereof) in Boruto, but that liking or not liking it is ultimately a personal decision and it's not fair to judge someone solely for liking (or disliking) Boruto.",

I hear the new Kara arc and story with kawaki are good and we are FINALLY ADAPTING MANGA STORY INTO THE ANIME and its all been pretty good, but I can't call it a good anime because of the over 150 episodes of trash we got. If that didn't happen, and boruto was a seasonal anime so that the manga could produce content for the anime to adapt instead of giving us shit, I probally would've liked boruto, and the series as a whole would've been good. But 20 episodes out of 215 don't make a good series. \n\nI agree with the war arc thing though. I liked the war arc. It was interesting, and madara was being built up for the whole series and Toby being a main villain was also built up and slowly hinted in his early interactions. I personally never thought the akasuki themselves would be the biggest threat in Naruto, since they seemed pretty weak with narutos progression, and them already defeating a few of them early on, but the thing with kaguya did feel rushed and the war arc, while super enjoyable including the filler, it wasn't good structurally. Still had some emotional moments and bad ass ones though and I loved it.",

Boruto could have been fucking great if they basically made it seasonal like you said. Surely they had the foresight to know the scrutiny it would be under and the amount of fans they\u2019ve missed out on because of the excessive fillers. Honestly I feel like they should have waited till about now to start airing the anime if they wanted it weekly. But perhaps they\u2019ve been making enough money to where it doesn\u2019t fucking matter which is a shame because it clearly means it\u2019s a cash grab but oh well I\u2019m just gonna keep enjoying Boruto now that it\u2019s gotten good and I endured the hellacious gambit of fillers lol",

That now, the world revolved around money, and how money was power. And Naruto couldn't comprehend it fully. It was sorta like the pain speech, but it was more back and forth. It should've been animated and boruto should've been more about Naruto dealing with the political aspects of the world and facing the issue of money being everything, while trying to maintain his idea of peace, and being a new parent and newly wed. Your idea of having borutos generation be super smart and fixing the holes in Narutos peaceful world isn't bad, but it wouldn't work. It'd be impossible. And Honesty a little disrespectful. Having Naruto accept that the world has changed, and that he should just live his own life with his new family would be better, because honestly the Naruto we got in boruto is kinda bad.

Even amegakure, which would actually be a kages job, and in the kages power to help. Given they have the permission of the lord in charge of it. Its a more political matter, that boruto and his group wouldn't deal with. The anime has tried out most of your ideas and they flopped pretty badly, not gonna lie. \n\nSomething you mentioned was that they wouldn't have clearance, and that brings the whole idea down, because if they did, they'd be rouges and would end up un jail or dead. Since they are the kids of the most well known people in the entire world, they'd be in jail for a while. It honestly sounds like a decent idea, but the more thought you put into it it sounds like a bad childish version of batman.

            "body": "That's the right mindset to have when in relation to boruto. Sadly I can't have it since it was my 3rd anime after Naruto and Naruto shipuden and everyone was saying it's amazing and top tier, so I watched and was disappointed. Didn't like the story, the art was really bad and too vibrant but I actually didn't mind that part because it was a sign that it was a time of peace and boruto was enjoying the life Naruto gave, and early Naruto was similar. It was bright and cheery while Naruto enjoyed his life and didn't care much about anything. It was the voice acting that struck me hard at first as a dub watcher so I switched to sub but it wasn't much better, so I went back to dub. The next thing was the character design. Specifically for boruto. But I was willing to let that slide. But as I watched more, and the story got progressively more boring and uninteresting, I was starting to see more problems and lose interest. I kept watching because I felt like I had to, but the bad plot that didn't seem to ever connect, episodes feeling incomplete (Specifically episode 11 with the whole sumire thing) characters being bland and the original cast being dog shit besides shino, the main character being unlikable and honestly in debates of being one of the most annoying characters in the entire franchise with part 1 Sakura and early konohamaru, the whole deal with sarada and borutos connection, like it honestly feels like a fanfiction version of Naruto and Sasuke (fuck NaruSasu), and them bringing back things from Naruto and some how making them worse and cringey like they belong on tic toc (new 7 ninja swordsman im looking at you) all combined to make a bad show. I got to episode 150 and stopped. And before anyone tells me I should've continued, episode 151 was the newest episode and I started it, but fell asleep during it and didn't feel like waiting a week to feel disappointed so I dropped boruto. I dropped anime as a whole until my friend convinced me to watch bleach episode 315 14 minutes in, when ichigo grabs aizen and throws him in a mountain. I got back into anime and realized that boruto was just bad, and people were overhyping it. \n\nWhat really sold the anime as shit for me though was how people talked about the manga. The first 10 chapters and we already have an actual story with characters we want to follow. Out of 10 chapters, only 3 of them got adapted and it took 60 episodes and ended up being turned into a movie which was better then the arc in the anime. Those other 7 arcs didn't get animated till like months after I've dropped boruto.",

And there's certainly discussion to be had, I just think it's childish to hate on people who liked it. Personally I talked with a friend of mine a few months ago and his position was that despite the flaws he could still enjoy the anime, I think that's a perfectly fine position to take. Now when people deny the problems it starts to get tricky, specially with how subjective all this stuff is. \n\nWell, this hasn't been a very well structured argument but basically what I want to say is that there can be discussion about the problems (or lack thereof) in Boruto, but that liking or not liking it is ultimately a personal decision and it's not fair to judge someone solely for liking (or disliking) Boruto.",

Boruto could have been fucking great if they basically made it seasonal like you said. Surely they had the foresight to know the scrutiny it would be under and the amount of fans they\u2019ve missed out on because of the excessive fillers. Honestly I feel like they should have waited till about now to start airing the anime if they wanted it weekly. But perhaps they\u2019ve been making enough money to where it doesn\u2019t fucking matter which is a shame because it clearly means it\u2019s a cash grab but oh well I\u2019m just gonna keep enjoying Boruto now that it\u2019s gotten good and I endured the hellacious gambit of fillers lol",

In the mission, the guy he's facing goes on about how the world is different, and how it was *NARUTO* that changed everything, and made it worse. That now, the world revolved around money, and how money was power. And Naruto couldn't comprehend it fully. It was sorta like the pain speech, but it was more back and forth. It should've been animated and boruto should've been more about Naruto dealing with the political aspects of the world and facing the issue of money being everything, while trying to maintain his idea of peace, and being a new parent and newly wed. Your idea of having borutos generation be super smart and fixing the holes in Narutos peaceful world isn't bad, but it wouldn't work. It'd be impossible. And Honesty a little disrespectful. Having Naruto accept that the world has changed, and that he should just live his own life with his new family would be better, because honestly the Naruto we got in boruto is kinda bad. If he had build up to be the depressed man we see In early boruto (Im talking anime as an anime only) then it would've been way better",

Just that in this more peaceful age, a more interesting talent would have a focus on politics than combat. There are infinite fires to put out and finite people to fight them. The greater cooperation would make the villages less readily responsive as well. So while the gokage work together and put out the big fires, boruto and co deal with things (beyond their reasonable position and clearance) that threaten individual villages and kages\u2019 positions. Things like quelling unrest, uncovering conspiracies, and deradicalizing movements. All the things naruto\u2019s generation has too many eyes on them to deal with effectively.\n\nTo;dr I was not suggesting boruto run around fixing every one of the parents\u2019 problems, just the threadbare patches that tend to go overlooked(like amegakure)",

Something similar happened In the anime already. It was the sumire thing. It wasn't good and was honestly TRASH! But everything you described is basically Sasukes job. Even amegakure, which would actually be a kages job, and in the kages power to help. Given they have the permission of the lord in charge of it. Its a more political matter, that boruto and his group wouldn't deal with. The anime has tried out most of your ideas and they flopped pretty badly, not gonna lie. \n\nSomething you mentioned was that they wouldn't have clearance, and that brings the whole idea down, because if they did, they'd be rouges and would end up un jail or dead. Since they are the kids of the most well known people in the entire world, they'd be in jail for a while. It honestly sounds like a decent idea, but the more thought you put into it it sounds like a bad childish version of batman. Maybe batman isn't the best example, but that's honestly the vibes I'm getting from it",

And there's certainly discussion to be had, I just think it's childish to hate on people who liked it. Personally I talked with a friend of mine a few months ago and his position was that despite the flaws he could still enjoy the anime, I think that's a perfectly fine position to take. Now when people deny the problems it starts to get tricky, specially with how subjective all this stuff is. \n\nWell, this hasn't been a very well structured argument but basically what I want to say is that there can be discussion about the problems (or lack thereof) in Boruto, but that liking or not liking it is ultimately a personal decision and it's not fair to judge someone solely for liking (or disliking) Boruto.",

Just that in this more peaceful age, a more interesting talent would have a focus on politics than combat. There are infinite fires to put out and finite people to fight them. The greater cooperation would make the villages less readily responsive as well. So while the gokage work together and put out the big fires, boruto and co deal with things (beyond their reasonable position and clearance) that threaten individual villages and kages\u2019 positions. Things like quelling unrest, uncovering conspiracies, and deradicalizing movements. All the things naruto\u2019s generation has too many eyes on them to deal with effectively.\n\nTo;dr I was not suggesting boruto run around fixing every one of the parents\u2019 problems, just the threadbare patches that tend to go overlooked(like amegakure)",

Something similar happened In the anime already. It was the sumire thing. It wasn't good and was honestly TRASH! But everything you described is basically Sasukes job. Even amegakure, which would actually be a kages job, and in the kages power to help. Given they have the permission of the lord in charge of it. Its a more political matter, that boruto and his group wouldn't deal with. The anime has tried out most of your ideas and they flopped pretty badly, not gonna lie. \n\nSomething you mentioned was that they wouldn't have clearance, and that brings the whole idea down, because if they did, they'd be rouges and would end up un jail or dead. Since they are the kids of the most well known people in the entire world, they'd be in jail for a while. It honestly sounds like a decent idea, but the more thought you put into it it sounds like a bad childish version of batman. Maybe batman isn't the best example, but that's honestly the vibes I'm getting from it",

Its still enjoyable and the only anime to make me cry in both sadness and hype. Most anime can't to either.",

Something similar happened In the anime already. It was the sumire thing. It wasn't good and was honestly TRASH! But everything you described is basically Sasukes job. Even amegakure, which would actually be a kages job, and in the kages power to help. Given they have the permission of the lord in charge of it. Its a more political matter, that boruto and his group wouldn't deal with. The anime has tried out most of your ideas and they flopped pretty badly, not gonna lie. \n\nSomething you mentioned was that they wouldn't have clearance, and that brings the whole idea down, because if they did, they'd be rouges and would end up un jail or dead. Since they are the kids of the most well known people in the entire world, they'd be in jail for a while. It honestly sounds like a decent idea, but the more thought you put into it it sounds like a bad childish version of batman. Maybe batman isn't the best example, but that's honestly the vibes I'm getting from it",
