    "body": "So I bought a cock sock. It's a knit, well, sock, meant to keep a man's naughty bits warm. They have all kinds of styles - a giraffe, the eiffel tower, etc... I found one that is a rooster! (SFW)  http://imgur.com/a/AmsIkWC\n#\nFYI, if you clicked on that link, technically you \"saw my cock and laughed,\" which is 90% of what being my sb is all about.\n#\nAnyway, I bring this thing to a date with my sb.  I know that I am about to drop the daddest of all dad jokes on her.  After this date, all of her kids are going to be born with a mortgage and an uncanny ability to tell when someone is touching the thermostat.  Somehow, she doesn't notice me giggling all through dinner.\n#\nFinally, we get to the hotel room. I go into the bathroom, and strip naked except for my cock sock. I strut out of the bathroom with a big ole grin yelling \"COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO BABY!\" It works. She falls off the bed laughing and crying. For a moment, it was glorious. My whole family thinks I'm a scrawny nerd that all the girls laugh at. But actually, I'm a scrawny nerd that all the girls laugh at with an *occasionally well dressed penis.*  Look at me now MOM! I'm packing a full grown rooster, not that \"little pecker\" you zipped into my onesie when you thought I was too young to remember it.  Then my SB manages the words: \"Is that a *chicken*????\"  She... she didn't get the pun...\n#\n....\n#\n....\n#\nSo then what the fuck is she laughing at???? Without the pun, I'm just an old man with a small penis that happens to be on fleek. Nothing funny about that.\n#\nFrom now on, my seeking profile is going to read \"If you want to have sex with me, you must be able to correctly identify barnyard animals. Don't ask why. It's a surprise.\"",

I'd be going about my day, hanging in the kitchen, coloring, whatever, and he'd walk in the room and chat with me. Oftentimes his smirk would tip me off that I'm missing something and I'd look down and laugh like yep... elephant. \n\nI appreciate your self-deprecating sense of humor. A rare \"bird,\" indeed. :)\n\nThanks for the laugh!",
