Starting with towel dried hair I put in some paste with a tiny bit of wax, then it's a process of blow drying with the flat funnel attachment and using your fingers to hold and shape the first curve by pinching and holding your hair up from the scalp and curled over your finger. Lock that in with some cold air, then hold that first curve against your head pushed back with your palm, now blow back the ends of your hair to create the second wave, and lock it in with cold air. Finish with a high hold product, like tigi matte wax.\n\n[I drew this to help demonstrate](https://i.imgur.com/eaBWOZl.jpg)\n\nWith so much blow drying you have to be careful not to fry your hair. My hair would start to get weird by the end of the week if I was overdoing, so I'd wear a hat and do nothing with it over the weekend to give it some time to recover. Blow dry it just until it starts to feel dry. If you're blow drying already dry hair I think that's when the damage begins to happen.",

Mixing the wax and paste together works too, but the texture isn't as good as when you layer them in one at a time. The paste by itself is a fairly weak hold for my hair, which is 4-5 inches long.",

Probably not ideal directions but there are plenty of tutorials online.\n\nGl man, excellent progress.",

Starting with towel dried hair I put in some paste with a tiny bit of wax, then it's a process of blow drying with the flat funnel attachment and using your fingers to hold and shape the first curve by pinching and holding your hair up from the scalp and curled over your finger. Lock that in with some cold air, then hold that first curve against your head pushed back with your palm, now blow back the ends of your hair to create the second wave, and lock it in with cold air. Finish with a high hold product, like tigi matte wax.\n\n[I drew this to help demonstrate](https://i.imgur.com/eaBWOZl.jpg)\n\nWith so much blow drying you have to be careful not to fry your hair. My hair would start to get weird by the end of the week if I was overdoing, so I'd wear a hat and do nothing with it over the weekend to give it some time to recover. Blow dry it just until it starts to feel dry. If you're blow drying already dry hair I think that's when the damage begins to happen.",
