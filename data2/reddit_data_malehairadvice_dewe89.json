You\u2019re a handsome young man with a good haircut who writes eloquently. That puts you miles ahead of much of Reddit in terms of succeeding in the real world. Stop posting to r/amiugly - you\u2019re not. Stop posting in r/relationships about how to talk to girls: go find a place in the real world where there are some and *practice*. Ask them about themselves. Listen actively and ask intelligent follow-up questions. Smile freely. If you don\u2019t have one already, find a hobby that allows you to physically exert yourself regularly: soccer, weights, tennis, rock climbing, whatever. Do it a few days a week, improve at it, and watch your external handsomeness and internal strength and confidence grow. Look for random acts of kindness to perform and go do em - the world around you will be better for it, and so will you.\n\nReddit is fun, but life is lived out there. You\u2019re young. Appear reasonably healthy and handsome. Probably decently well off since you\u2019re at a private all-boys school. The world is your oyster. Stop doubting yourself and go get it.",
