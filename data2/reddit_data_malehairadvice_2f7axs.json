I don't want someone to feel discouraged to grow a beard just because it comes in a bit patchy or may not connect. Adding a little facial hair, or any change for that matter has a possibility to greatly improve someone's facial aesthetics, it would be a real shame for someone to never know because of a \"general rule of thumb\" that they read on the internet. \n\n",

I acknowledged that I shamelessly used celebrities as a cheapshot to prove my point, so I don't know why you're acting like I didn't admit to it. \n\nIn your OP, I feel you gave the wrong impression of this sub. I don't want someone to feel discouraged to grow a beard just because it comes in a bit patchy or may not connect. Adding a little facial hair, or any change for that matter has a possibility to greatly improve someone's facial aesthetics, it would be a real shame for someone to never know because of a \"general rule of thumb\" that they read on the internet. \n\n",
