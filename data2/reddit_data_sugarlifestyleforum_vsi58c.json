    "body": "I'm embarrassed to post this because I feel like I'm smart enough to see through most scams; nevertheless, here I am. I've been in the bowl for about 2 years and somewhat of a lurker on this subreddit. I live in Orange County, CA so have mostly met people from Southern CA. I've had a few successful arrangements and even had a couple \"vanilla\" relationships that evolved out of arrangements. I feel like I have enough knowledge to see through 99% of the scams out there, but I got completely had this evening. I guess I'm sharing this to help the community and do a bit of therapeutic venting for myself. **TL;DR: below.** \n\nSo I'm in my early 40's and met an early 20 something via Seeking. We FaceTimed, talked about expectations and allowances. She made it sound like she was a bit new to everything and wasn't too sure if she wanted an arrangement, but felt good about meeting me. We then had an initial M&G dinner that went relatively well. She was a bit socially awkward, but attractive, and we found we had some things in common. We talked about some Netflix shows we both wanted to watch, and I told her about a drink I made that she might like. Despite her awkwardness, she was handsy and used a lot of \"we-should-do-this\" language, which usually suggests interests. I gave her a couple hundred for the M&G thinking it would help establish some trust, and we talked about getting together at my place for dinner and that previously mentioned drink a few days later.\n\nThe day we were supposed to get together she canceled on me last minute, complaining about a migraine. I assumed that was her way of saying \"I'm not interested\" or \"scared to move forward\", but she later asked if we could reschedule. So we planned to get together the following week. A couple days later she asked me for an advance b/c her rent was due. I simply said, that's a non-starter and assumed that would be the end of the story. She said she \"totally understood\" and was just asking as a last resort to prevent penalties, but she still wanted to get together. All together we had been talking for a total of about two weeks. \n\nThe day we were set to meet, she texted me asking if it was okay if I provided our agreed upon \"gift\" up-front because she was a bit nervous about everything (that probably should have been the red-flag I needed, but it wouldn't be the first time I've had that request). I didn't feel too comfortable about that, but agreed thinking that she was just nervous about everything and it kind of went along with her social awkwardness. I also did a bit of sleuthing on her. I have her full name, iPhone number, and address. I noticed she was the plaintiff in a court case (for what that's worth), and prior to our meeting, she hadn't been active on Seeking for a week. So I figured if she couldn't be much of a scammer, or else she would be talking to several people online and her info would be so public. She was also valedictorian of her high-school back East\u2014for some reason I thought that was a green-flag that kind of offset some of the red-flags mentioned above.\n\nFast-forward to the evening we're to meet again. She shows up to my house. and we talked for a short while, and she then asks about the PPM. I give her a gift bag and she immediately throws the meaningful part of her gift in her wallet, ignoring the specific vegan candy and snacks I got her. We talked a bit more (she was clearly nervous). I offered her water and told her where the bathroom was if she needed to use it. She said she did need to use it and went off visibly and audibly nervous. After about 10-15min I knew something wasn't right; I started to suspect she had bailed. I went outside my house to see if my window screen had been knocked out. Sure enough, there it was, laying on the ground. Very disheartened, I cleaned my place up and devoured the vegan candy and snacks she left behind.\n\nNot long after, I went to lookup her Seeking profile just to see if I could gather some more info (for what? I don't know) and noticed she was already active again\u2014I suspect looking for her next victim. So basically she ran this whole scam on me for nearly two weeks just to make something just short of 1k. \n\n**TL;DR:** After talking to a POT SB for a couple weeks; FaceTiming her; and meeting her for dinner, she came to my house and within 15 or so minutes took her \"gift\" and snuck out of my house through my bathroom window.\n\nI know I'm SOL here in terms of recourse, and I can't post personal info on people through this sub, but is there anyway I could/should report her on Seeking just to try to prevent others from having to go through this BS?",

Then for 4 years he proceeded to call & text me and even texted me his new phone #, then added me on snapchat.

To me it sounds more like a toe dipping, anxious girl who was blinded by the money but got cold feet the moment she was supposed to really 'deliver' the sugar, and fled in panic.\n\nBecause it just doesn't make sense for a pro rinser to give their real identity and put in so much time and effort for one PPM, and then have to go through the whole 2 weeks circus (with all possible danger that comes with it) with another pot again. Easier and far less time consuming to enter a SR and collect 4 PPM's instead.\n\nAnyway, it happened and I feel sorry for you. Learn from it even though it was a hard and expensive lesson, and try to recognize the red flags next time. It doesn't matter if those flags come from an anxious girl, or a pro rinser. :/",

I told her i would give it to her when she got to my place, of course she ghosted me\n\nSB I had gone on 1 platonic date, she was all over me, practically wanted to F' me post meet and greet in the parking lot. We arranged an intimate date 2 days later, she texts me that morning and asks for 2 ppm to help her with rent. Tell her I dont send money to anyone I dont have an existing relationship with, but will gladly give her 2 ppm in good faith on our 1st official date. She shows up visually more nervous then the 1st time I met her, within 10 minutes she's trying to get me to the bedroom which is not the typical experience Ive had with previous SB, but thought it was a good sign seeing we had such good chemistry at the meet and greet. But out of nowhere, she says before we move forward can you give me the 2 ppm..?\n\nNow this is the first time in many years where I've experienced any SB, ask for money right before intimacy. Red flags were going up, especially since she had asked me to give her the money before even coming to my place. So I tell her its on my bedside table, and that she can take it when she leaves. Almost like clockwork, she gets a phone call within 5 minutes from a friend who has been in a bad car wreck and she needs to leave. Imagine my surprise when she tells me she has to leave immediately. It seemed way to much like a pre planned setup, where she planned her friend to call so she would have a reason to leave with the money. It really makes sense to, and most likely the reason she tried to escalate things so quickly and get me to the bedroom right away, she probably had it planned all along for her friend to call her about 20 minutes after arriving there.\n\nAll in all, those are my only 2 experiences with potential scammers, other then that I have been mildly rinsed which is altogether different then being outright scammed.",

That was always the back-stop. The ones who I was pretty sure were scammers, would stop their attempts at meeting me, after I insisted on getting their real name and number (I never move forward with any SB without running a full background check on them, confirming their aged social media accounts, etc).\n\nAnd then, add in that your POT \"...wasn't too sure if she wanted an arrangement\", and that she cancelled a meeting at the last minute. That is a Bernie Madoff level of sophisticated manipulation (i.e. he made it difficult for many people to give him money).\n\nAnd then: \"she hadn't been active on Seeking for a week\".\n\nWith those facts, I would've given 1,000 to 1 odds that she was a scammer.",

In the end, the SB is upset because of not getting money after, not because of the act itself.  So in that respect they are both in the same situation - upset about a loss of money.  \n\nAnd if you really want to insist there is some cardinal difference - well, the man got that money in the first place by working a job, sacrificing his body to do so, so then being emotionally manipulated and robbed in such a personal situation, that is also a personal body violation - he did all that work, slaving away for money, only to have it stolen from him.  The power over his own body was compromised in that way. \n\nI am not trying to minimize - or maximize - what either party feels upon being cheated here - I am saying that both are the same - two sides of the same coin.  Should have equal sympathy for either party when they are the one cheated and stolen from.\n\nAnd as a final aside, date r*** is really just r***.  Non consensual, period.

Instead it is a civil claim for damages.  \n\nYou may not like it but you don't get to redefine the law or what terms of art mean.\n\nNow if you said no sex until payment up front and there is no pay and sex is forced anyway, that is non consensual.

As Op said, it was only like 1000$ and she exposed everything about herself. Logic says scammers would not do it. Would you say where you live, work etc to someone who you plan to scam?",

What I defend is that she was a scammer and had this intentions. Maybe try to actually read what I write so you take something from it. Also money and physical act is something quite different. Money are replaceable, dignity and mental health not so much. When you agree to have sex under certain conditions - if it is money, with condom, without certain practices - it is abuse or even rape. When you steal money it is theft. She stole money, no matter the reasons she did it. But it was not intentional scam. I wonder why you do not get/can not see the point I am making. Also jesus 500$... I guess we both live very different lifestyle. I think the OP is more touched by the fact she ran away like that, I bet he consider himself a nice guy. But someone felt the need to run away thru bathroom window. I will repeat myself, I think it was too fast for her, she got scared, was in money trouble and voila, shit happened and she stole money when she had the chance.",

            "body": "It seems to me that scamming, both ways,  is a consequence of using the internet to find a SR. I have never used the internet to find an SR and I've never been scammed. There have been a couple really bad situations concomitant to an SR.. but not a scam. Therefore, if you're really that anxious about being scammed then don't use the internet. \n\nThe internet by its very nature is initially  going to be very transactional. So, who makes the 1st move by trusting the other? Who has the most to lose? I would argue the SB has more risk. No one wants to lose $1k but that sure as fuck beats being what comes close to being raped. \n\nIt sounds like the girl here is a novice thief. But, she won't be a novice forever. It also sounds like you have a $1k marker on the street that you could sell and recoup some of your losses.",

I told her i would give it to her when she got to my place, of course she ghosted me\n\nSB I had gone on 1 platonic date, she was all over me, practically wanted to F' me post meet and greet in the parking lot. We arranged an intimate date 2 days later, she texts me that morning and asks for 2 ppm to help her with rent. Tell her I dont send money to anyone I dont have an existing relationship with, but will gladly give her 2 ppm in good faith on our 1st official date. She shows up visually more nervous then the 1st time I met her, within 10 minutes she's trying to get me to the bedroom which is not the typical experience Ive had with previous SB, but thought it was a good sign seeing we had such good chemistry at the meet and greet. But out of nowhere, she says before we move forward can you give me the 2 ppm..?\n\nNow this is the first time in many years where I've experienced any SB, ask for money right before intimacy. Red flags were going up, especially since she had asked me to give her the money before even coming to my place. So I tell her its on my bedside table, and that she can take it when she leaves. Almost like clockwork, she gets a phone call within 5 minutes from a friend who has been in a bad car wreck and she needs to leave. Imagine my surprise when she tells me she has to leave immediately. It seemed way to much like a pre planned setup, where she planned her friend to call so she would have a reason to leave with the money. It really makes sense to, and most likely the reason she tried to escalate things so quickly and get me to the bedroom right away, she probably had it planned all along for her friend to call her about 20 minutes after arriving there.\n\nAll in all, those are my only 2 experiences with potential scammers, other then that I have been mildly rinsed which is altogether different then being outright scammed.",

Most people don't really plan to make trouble in public places like that.\n\nAlso a couple vanilla dates help you get a bit of understanding with her and make it costly for scammers to string the game along. Who would want to spend weeks wine and dine with a guy for a risky 1k? It also help the real SB get comfortable with you.",

Consent is given for promise of payment.  \n\nBreaking the promise doesn't make it non consensual retroactively.  It is instead a breach of contract, a civil claim.   You could also allege fraud if there was never any intention of paying.   But again, for purposes of r*** it is still consensual.  \n\nIt is why when you buy something with a promise to pay and then don't pay you aren't charged with larceny.  Instead it is a civil claim for damages.  \n\nYou may not like it but you don't get to redefine the law or what terms of art mean.\n\nNow if you said no sex until payment up front and there is no pay and sex is forced anyway, that is non consensual.  But the situation here was where there would be promise of pay after.",

She asked for 2 PPM upfront and bailed out a window.  \n\n\n>I mean\u2026 i think she was only really desperate and also scared. She was obvipusly not comfortable and you say \u201chere are the bathroom if you need it\u201d aka \u201cshower so I can fuck you right now\u201d. \n\nWhen i offer the bathroom to any quest, its my way of saying would you like to piss or shit seeing that you have a 1 hour drive to my house. Not sure why you're implying she should take a shower, This SD didnt meet her at a hotel where sex is implied immediately. Typically when SB come to my place, we talk, listen to music, eat some food and then have sex.  \n\n\n>Not very assuring and calming. I always thought that SR is about building relationship, not jumping into sex on second or third date. But I guess I have just more requirements - as a proffesional and also SB there is line.\n\nWhere'd did you see him say they havent tried to build a relationship..? They meet for dinner, they facetimed, and now they have a date at his place. Is this not how things work in vanilla dating these days.? Or are you looking to be courted for 3 months before you hold my hand, and 6 months before you kiss me..?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Should she avoid the situation whatsoever if she felt uncomfortable with you? Definitely. Was she probably too desperate to give money back and go home? Yes.\n\nShe was nervous because she knew what she was about to do to him.  \n\n\n>A lot of girls are getting into sugaring or SW thinking how easy it will be. That all the men they will make them super comfortable and they will feel no pressure etc. It is not for everyone and these are the consequences. ***So I would not see you as a scammed guy, but someone who tried to find SB and was once unsuccesful.***\n\nWay to victim blame..! Please be sure to come back and say this exact same thing to every SB that gets pumped and dumped, or gets stiffed..! ;)",

You really think you have more experience dating men then women do? Also in the whole context there is no blame, there is explanation what may have gone bad. Constructive criticism because that is what helps in avoiding similar situation. Simple. And it is just one PPM. PPM is for TIME, not sex. Or maybe for some but that depends on personal preference. \n\nQuestion. If you plan to scam someone, will you give them your address, phone number, info where you work?",

Money are replaceable, dignity and mental health not so much. When you agree to have sex under certain conditions - if it is money, with condom, without certain practices - it is abuse or even rape. When you steal money it is theft. She stole money, no matter the reasons she did it. But it was not intentional scam. I wonder why you do not get/can not see the point I am making. Also jesus 500$... I guess we both live very different lifestyle. I think the OP is more touched by the fact she ran away like that, I bet he consider himself a nice guy. But someone felt the need to run away thru bathroom window. I will repeat myself, I think it was too fast for her, she got scared, was in money trouble and voila, shit happened and she stole money when she had the chance.",

In the end, the SB is upset because of not getting money after, not because of the act itself.  So in that respect they are both in the same situation - upset about a loss of money.  \n\nAnd if you really want to insist there is some cardinal difference - well, the man got that money in the first place by working a job, sacrificing his body to do so, so then being emotionally manipulated and robbed in such a personal situation, that is also a personal body violation - he did all that work, slaving away for money, only to have it stolen from him.  The power over his own body was compromised in that way. \n\nI am not trying to minimize - or maximize - what either party feels upon being cheated here - I am saying that both are the same - two sides of the same coin.  Should have equal sympathy for either party when they are the one cheated and stolen from.\n\nAnd as a final aside, date r*** is really just r***.  Non consensual, period.

Instead it is a civil claim for damages.  \n\nYou may not like it but you don't get to redefine the law or what terms of art mean.\n\nNow if you said no sex until payment up front and there is no pay and sex is forced anyway, that is non consensual.

When you agree to have sex under certain conditions - if it is money, with condom, without certain practices - it is abuse or even rape. When you steal money it is theft. She stole money, no matter the reasons she did it. But it was not intentional scam. I wonder why you do not get/can not see the point I am making. Also jesus 500$... I guess we both live very different lifestyle. I think the OP is more touched by the fact she ran away like that, I bet he consider himself a nice guy.

So in that respect they are both in the same situation - upset about a loss of money.  \n\nAnd if you really want to insist there is some cardinal difference - well, the man got that money in the first place by working a job, sacrificing his body to do so, so then being emotionally manipulated and robbed in such a personal situation, that is also a personal body violation - he did all that work, slaving away for money, only to have it stolen from him.  The power over his own body was compromised in that way. \n\nI am not trying to minimize - or maximize - what either party feels upon being cheated here - I am saying that both are the same - two sides of the same coin.  Should have equal sympathy for either party when they are the one cheated and stolen from.\n\nAnd as a final aside, date r*** is really just r***.  Non consensual, period.  Not analogous to this at all.",

Instead it is a civil claim for damages.  \n\nYou may not like it but you don't get to redefine the law or what terms of art mean.\n\nNow if you said no sex until payment up front and there is no pay and sex is forced anyway, that is non consensual.

When you agree to have sex under certain conditions - if it is money, with condom, without certain practices - it is abuse or even rape. When you steal money it is theft. She stole money, no matter the reasons she did it. But it was not intentional scam. I wonder why you do not get/can not see the point I am making. Also jesus 500$... I guess we both live very different lifestyle. I think the OP is more touched by the fact she ran away like that, I bet he consider himself a nice guy.

The power over his own body was compromised in that way. \n\nI am not trying to minimize - or maximize - what either party feels upon being cheated here - I am saying that both are the same - two sides of the same coin.  Should have equal sympathy for either party when they are the one cheated and stolen from.\n\nAnd as a final aside, date r*** is really just r***.  Non consensual, period.

Instead it is a civil claim for damages.  \n\nYou may not like it but you don't get to redefine the law or what terms of art mean.\n\nNow if you said no sex until payment up front and there is no pay and sex is forced anyway, that is non consensual.

Instead it is a civil claim for damages.  \n\nYou may not like it but you don't get to redefine the law or what terms of art mean.\n\nNow if you said no sex until payment up front and there is no pay and sex is forced anyway, that is non consensual.  But the situation here was where there would be promise of pay after.",

So I am not at all sorry that I give benefit of doubt and diffirent point of view. My point is he should replay what happened, maybe take into consideration the responses here, along with mine.
