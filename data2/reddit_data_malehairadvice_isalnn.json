As a tip, keep your beard shaved or buzzed to a stubble level, it accentuates your beard but growing it out would only hide the strong jwline you already have. \n\nTo make your current haircut a little tighter and less of a \"my mom shaved my head because I had lice\" look, you can get a fade on the sides and back.\n\nEdit: I'm all for septum piercings but yours look a little big. I think a smaller one in silver would look great on you. Or one of those that close tight under the middle part of the nostrils almost like a ring. It's more subtle but still cool in my opinion.",
