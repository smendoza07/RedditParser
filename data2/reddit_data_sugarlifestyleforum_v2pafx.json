    "body": "I've been in the bowl for about a year now and have been successful in building long term relationships with several SDs with extremely high (by this subreddit's standards) allowances \\[mid to high X,XXX\\]. I have a unique approach to initial vetting that I would love to share with this community! I'd also love your feedback <3\n\n**YOUR PROFILE**\n\nWhen looking for an SD, I have a high standard for intelligence, kindness, looks (though admittedly less than vanilla), sexual prowess, and, quite frankly, sugar support. I hold myself to the same, if not higher standards. I'm healthy, happy, well connected, financially secure, highly educated and career oriented.\n\nI have a concise, clear profile that is explicit about wanting an intellectual/emotional connection, kinky sex, and financial support. I also state that I have a serious (open) relationship, so I'm not infinitely available (I'm not sure how many SDs this deters, but powerful men seem to fixate on this in a sexy way). My pictures are flattering, full body and face, smiling or smoldering, doing things I'm clearly passionate about, ranging from me in a bikini to me in a gown. I abide by mainstream beauty standard - tan, platinum blonde, long hair, manicured, styled, size 4.\n\n**INITIAL VETTING**\n\nI\u2019m not the ideal SB for everyone and not every SD is for me. I probably have an interest in \\~2%-5% of SDs that reach out to me on Seeking and only half of them can afford the allowance I hope for. That being said, I almost never talk about allowance until after a few dates and the SD brings it up (but before intimacy!). Rather, I try to gauge whether the person can afford his lifestyle, in addition to a very generous allowance, and if they ARE generous. I explore a much wider variety of questions to access overall compatibility/chemistry, but these are just the ones I use to gauge their financial compatibility:\n\n* **Financial Competence -** I ask about their business, how they made their money. Is it something they're extremely passionate about? Are they good at it/Can they explain/teach it to me such that I understand it? Are they competitive? Do they have the drive to win? For how long have they been successful? Do they have sustained wealth? I'm gauging if they're financially competent and if they will have the drive to win me. 99% of the time I steer clear of men in speculative industries like crypto, unless their involvement is highly sophisticated (e.g. quant trading).\n* **Financial Obligation** \\- Do they have children, how many, how old and where? Children are relatively large and unforgiving financial obligations that will (should) always take priority over sugar. It's not a disqualifier by any means, but you should take this into account when gauging the big picture. Have they been married? Are they now? Are they open? If they're cheaters, then I dip immediately. Btw (anecdotally) all SD's I've met that are going through or have recently gone through a divorce and have children, have ultimately not been a good match for me both financially and emotionally, but of course, I say the door is alway open if/when their situation changes.\n* **Generosity** \\- I always ask about their parents and siblings. Do they have a good relationship with them? Are they empathetic, secure, supportive with their loved ones. I love it when this question leads to some heart warming story of how they are proud to have been able to buy their parents a home or send their niece/nephew to college (displaying both financial status and generosity).\n* **Discretionary Spending Habits -** Where and how often do they travel? Oh, they have your own jet? What are the hourly operating costs? Where do they stay when they travel? Do they have a favorite hotel brand? Vacation homes? Generally, SD's who have a high discretionary budget (homes, cars, jets) are going to be very comfortable with a generous allowance.\n* **Discretionary Spending Tastes -** Do they have an appreciation for design and art? Or in other words, are they more utilitarian or do they value what is essentially entirely a luxury category? If their tastes align with yours, then align yourself with their tastes. Help them picture you as a missing piece to their life of luxury, that will enhance any other luxury they already have. What's their favorite restaurant? \"I've always dreamed of a Lady and the Tramp spaghetti first kiss, you know...\" Are they a car guy? \"I think I have the perfect outfit to match your Ferrari. Shall we see?\" What's their home like? What kind of architectural/interior design do they like? \"Oh, you designed and built your own home? Can I see a picture? Wow - it's gorgeous! How much did that kitchen cost!? You've obviously invested a lot of both money and love into your home, and it really paid off! Maybe I could cook for you in that kitchen sometime\".\n\nAs a quick exercise, mid X,XXX in monthly allowance would equate to earnings of 1.5M sitting in a single investment account with a 4% return rate (which is a historically low average return rate, to be safe). I would expect someone with just a third of that value parked in their garage (a Ferrari, a Model S and a G Class as an example) and who has proven to be **financially competent**, to have AT LEAST 1.5M liquid invested. And this is without even considering other forms of income.\n\nSo that's just (part of) the vetting process, but it's the most important to get right, or you'll end up wasting a lot of your time and the other person's time.\n\n**FIRST DATE**\n\nSecond most important is to make a great first in-person impression. This is especially true if you are highly selective. A potential good match (according to the above sections) is infrequent, so it's important to show up with your absolute best!\n\nOf course, you'll have made a good impression with your profile and initial chatting, but you should seek to further impress them on the first date (I never call it a meet & greet - I explicitly use the word \"date\"). The goal is for him to think or say \"Wow. You're even prettier/smarter than I initially expected\". Here are some of my tricks:\n\n* **Reliability -** Be on time. Just do it. No successful person is going to tolerate unreliability. And you shouldn't tolerate it either. If you HAVE to be late or reschedule, communicate early and often, and accept that they may NEXT you.\n* **Beauty -** Wear something you know they love. Perhaps they've made a comment about one of your pictures or an actress they admire or a color they love. Maybe this is a special restaurant to them - wear cute chopsticks in your hair for a sushi spot or a flowy red skirt for tapas.\n* **Gratitude -** Express your appreciation, for the date, for the chatting, for his affection and that you feel lucky to have met them. Show him you're having a great time and you're happy to be there. (Hopefully, this is true!)\n* **Attraction -** Show him you're attracted to him. \"Has anyone told you, you kind of look like \\[handsome actor\\]\". Stop him by a mirror or window  \"We look kind of hot together, don't we?\"\n* **Potential -** Tell him about your aspirations. You should have big plans for your life. You have beauty, brains and, most of all, time. These are resources most older, successful people wish they had more of, because they know exactly how to capitalize on it. Show him you know how to capitalize on it too. You're a rocket ship and YOU'RE inviting HIM to join in on YOUR journey. All complements, advice, and monetary gifts are propelling you towards your goals, and he can vicariously feel the satisfaction of winning when you win!\n* **Generosity -** Bring HIM a gift! I love to travel, and have frequently been abroad when a POT reaches out. So, I show him my attentiveness by preparing a little gift bag of a couple treats that from my travels/my experiences/my non-monetary wealth that I want to share with him! This surprises them (some times to tears), and 100% of the time is reciprocated in a generous monetary gift from them at the end of the first non-intimate date.\n* **Sexuality -** If you feel comfortable talking about sex, share what YOU like in bed. Blush a little! And ask him what he likes and why. Prioritize clear communication about boundaries and preferences over jumping into bed right away, discuss birth control, and NEVER sleep with him without exchanging STD/STI test results. Show him you know how to thrive in your sexuality, and that you prioritize both your safety and his.\n\nSo, hopefully you hit the ball out of the park on your first date. That's really 90% of the vetting/seduction efforts I put in. The rest really should be at your and his leisure, but always with very clear and concise communication, mutual respect and genuine human connection. If any of the 3 falter on your part or his, respectfully end the relationship until (if at all) they can be remedied.\n\nI hope this was helpful for ya'll! I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences. XOXO",

I don't think any of my SBs function at the level you function at, it's just a different level of sugar. But it's interesting to read about how you go about it. I am surprised at the ratio between what allowance you are looking for, and what level of wealth from the SD. I would have expected that someone who has a jet, and a garage full of Ferraris, would be spending more on their SB. Is the expectation that they have multiple SBs? Or do you require exclusivity?",

At the start of my SR with my platinum blonde size 4, we saw each other at least once per week and quickly became twice per week and more. We're exclusive, we're happy for over a year.  Hard to believe that any decently healthy, attractive and functional older gentlemen would be satisfied with the same allowance at 1 meet per month so it seems some fantasy and fiction are thrown in. Don't think it's accurate to classify yourself as an SB anyway, but you do you.",

To clarify those are abhorrent personality characteristics that drive away decent human beings and the vast majority (not all) of successful people.  If you said smart, aggressive, business savvy, manipulative if needed, and a salesman I would have said those make you rich.  Those are not wealth building characteristics but everyone has different moral values. \n\nBut hey if that's wha't behind the SB business model just stick with married men who you know will cheat.  Questionable morals anyway.  Just don't be one of the SB's who embraces immorality and prioritizes money only.  I knew 2 that thought they were smart and tried to blackmail or extort money from a few different SD's (usually married) one of them being me but I'm single so they picked the wrong guy.

I definitely had a late glow up in life, and can 100% tell the difference in how I'm treated (in both good and bad ways).\n\nThe most impactful improvements for me were:\n\n\\- Losing weight, but staying toned (keeping a butt)\n\n\\- Having an intentional style. A few people in here strongly disliked the \"chopsticks in hair\" comment, but the fact is, the more attention you gain overall, the more negative attention you gain as well. I have a lot of fun with my style. I take an idea/theme that's related to whatever it is I'm dressing up for, I think about what it would look like on stage or on the runway, then I dial it back by 30%. Its fun and playful for me, and SDs (and everyone) really appreciate both the unique style and how much I enjoy playing with it.\n\n\\- Moderate facial cosmetic procedures. I have lip filler (but I keep it light. 1/2 a syringe once a year), and a size small chin implant. The proportions of my face are now more elegant/sexy than cute (which they were more like before).\n\n\\- Going blonde. I have basically black hair naturally and an olive complexion, and never before in my life considered going blonde. I was playing around with FaceApp (a computer vision app you can download from the App Store), and made my hair different colors to see how it'd look, and blonde REALLY worked for me! I encourage everyone to try it out. Interestingly, a tamer blonde looks TERRIBLE on me (washes me out), but pushing past that into platinum changed the game completely. I get comments every single time I go out in public. One time a waiter even \\*\\*bowed down\\*\\* (yeah i know, it was a weird, dorky thing to do, but still really sweet.) to me at a restaurant saying \"omg you're hair!\". The light blonde can also flatter your figure, as it draws the eye up to the face, and contrasts less against your face  (making your head appear larger with respect to your body). The only downside is that it's extremely high maintenance. I'm in the chair ever month for hours, and every time I wash my hair (1-2x a week) I need to apply several products and style it or it looks very messy (damaged)\n\nFor those reading this comment, here is a helpful resource that I've used understanding aesthetic beauty: [Architypes 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vindicta/comments/m0uc3z/update_to_my_achetypes_post_im_still_working_on/), [Architypes 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vindicta/comments/m366jf/the_faces_of_the_archetypes_i_made_a_few_changes/)",

The phrasing with the word \"invest\" applies to both cases here.

There're all kinds of interests someone could invest money in, and those interests are worth sharing and talking about if they are something you really care about right?\"\n\nThis means that they're SPENDING (thanks boston\\_prof) money on something that is growing in value as they care for it. If someone is investing in their interests in cars, they might be collecting them (the example you gave). If they're investing in some other interest, a relationship for example, then then might be SPENDING on assets or activities that improve the quality and longevity of that relationship. And the \\*intention\\* of this sentence was to exemplify the range of observable spending habits.\n\nI'm assuming the pedanticism comes from an honest misunderstanding, but this phrasing is very common in the US where I'm from.",

This is my process, and maybe there is more that I\u2019m doing that I\u2019m not realizing in terms of vetting, but this process works for me.

These examples can help me better myself and more importantly, help members of this community.  \n\nLet\u2019s focus on a solution. Show me how you\u2019d do it better.

Being a size 4, tan, long platinum blonde, and likely a awesome gorgeous face and body probably allow you to get to that top 1% man who passes the vetting.   So I would argue its not so much the vetting, but what you are able to bring to the table that wins you success.",

I am reasonably attractive and I have money too. \n\nA guy with 10 mil is able to give me a beautiful experience which I expect comfortably. \n\nAnd to be honest with you, it is hard to spot wealth. Many wealthy men I met are very low key. He might have 50 mil and if he walks pass you, you wouldn\u2019t know. \n\nI met this guy recently in another country. He looks very ordinary. Okay, he drives Maserati but many lawyers with a good salary can afford it too. Hotel is St Regis in Singapore (okay, one K per night but only for 12 days, a lawyer can afford that too)\u2026 \n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t matter where we go, he can find a private car park in a condominium building especially in the areas rich people live. The first time he randomly drove in a building and parked his car, I said \u201c I don\u2019t think we can park here, it says private parking 24/7 tow away\u201d, he replied : my friend is away so I can use his car park; then it happened again, he replied : my friend owns an apartment here but he doesn\u2019t have a car so I can use his Carpark temporarily. \u201c \n\nDude, why don\u2019t you just tell me you own them all? \ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude49 \n\nSo all the apartments add up, it\u2019s much more than 10 mil. That even factors in he\u2019s got a mortgage on every single of them. But I doubt he has. Not a risk taker, this guy, doesn\u2019t believe in crypto and told me not to touch it either. Guess he\u2019s putting most of his money in properties. \n\nPeople with 50 mil tell you they only have 10 mil. It\u2019s usually the case. \n\nJust like I often tell my friends I have an office job 8:30-5 and I have a mortgage on my place. Neither is true.",

At least I think so! I have never had someone offer me what I'm looking for off the bat. It's only been for offers far below what I'm looking for and generally PPM (also not my jam).",

If you look again, 3 of the 5 points in my \"Initial Vetting\" section actually have nothing to do with flamboyance and are more about their behaviors and values, the most important being their financial competence.",

At the start of my SR with my platinum blonde size 4, we saw each other at least once per week and quickly became twice per week and more. We're exclusive, we're happy for over a year.  Hard to believe that any decently healthy, attractive and functional older gentlemen would be satisfied with the same allowance at 1 meet per month so it seems some fantasy and fiction are thrown in. Don't think it's accurate to classify yourself as an SB anyway, but you do you.",

Questionable morals anyway.  Just don't be one of the SB's who embraces immorality and prioritizes money only.  I knew 2 that thought they were smart and tried to blackmail or extort money from a few different SD's (usually married) one of them being me but I'm single so they picked the wrong guy.  They're in prison now......and not rich.",

However successful men who fit your profile almost all have big ego's and do not like to share For them to be ok with you being with multiple other men, but at the same time saying you love them all (which you wrote somewhere in this thread), and finally having a BF whom you care about more who is ok with all of this seems very very far fetched",

I definitely had a late glow up in life, and can 100% tell the difference in how I'm treated (in both good and bad ways).\n\nThe most impactful improvements for me were:\n\n\\- Losing weight, but staying toned (keeping a butt)\n\n\\- Having an intentional style. A few people in here strongly disliked the \"chopsticks in hair\" comment, but the fact is, the more attention you gain overall, the more negative attention you gain as well. I have a lot of fun with my style. I take an idea/theme that's related to whatever it is I'm dressing up for, I think about what it would look like on stage or on the runway, then I dial it back by 30%. Its fun and playful for me, and SDs (and everyone) really appreciate both the unique style and how much I enjoy playing with it.\n\n\\- Moderate facial cosmetic procedures. I have lip filler (but I keep it light. 1/2 a syringe once a year), and a size small chin implant. The proportions of my face are now more elegant/sexy than cute (which they were more like before).\n\n\\- Going blonde. I have basically black hair naturally and an olive complexion, and never before in my life considered going blonde. I was playing around with FaceApp (a computer vision app you can download from the App Store), and made my hair different colors to see how it'd look, and blonde REALLY worked for me! I encourage everyone to try it out. Interestingly, a tamer blonde looks TERRIBLE on me (washes me out), but pushing past that into platinum changed the game completely. I get comments every single time I go out in public. One time a waiter even \\*\\*bowed down\\*\\* (yeah i know, it was a weird, dorky thing to do, but still really sweet.) to me at a restaurant saying \"omg you're hair!\". The light blonde can also flatter your figure, as it draws the eye up to the face, and contrasts less against your face  (making your head appear larger with respect to your body). The only downside is that it's extremely high maintenance. I'm in the chair ever month for hours, and every time I wash my hair (1-2x a week) I need to apply several products and style it or it looks very messy (damaged)\n\nFor those reading this comment, here is a helpful resource that I've used understanding aesthetic beauty: [Architypes 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vindicta/comments/m0uc3z/update_to_my_achetypes_post_im_still_working_on/), [Architypes 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vindicta/comments/m366jf/the_faces_of_the_archetypes_i_made_a_few_changes/)",

If you look again, 3 of the 5 points in my \"Initial Vetting\" actually have nothing to do with flamboyance and are more about their behaviors and values, the most important being their **financial competence**.\n\nAlso, cars is just an example. There's all kinds of interests someone could invest money in, and those interests are worth sharing and talking about if they are something you really care about right?",

There're all kinds of interests someone could invest money in, and those interests are worth sharing and talking about if they are something you really care about right?\"\n\nThis means that they're SPENDING (thanks boston\\_prof) money on something that is growing in value as they care for it. If someone is investing in their interests in cars, they might be collecting them (the example you gave). If they're investing in some other interest, a relationship for example, then then might be SPENDING on assets or activities that improve the quality and longevity of that relationship.

I'm lucky enough to have a deep understanding of finances and business, as well as empathy, such that I can navigate a normal conversation (before meeting) and feel more or less confident about someone's financial beliefs and intentions.

I am reasonably attractive and I have money too. \n\nA guy with 10 mil is able to give me a beautiful experience which I expect comfortably. \n\nAnd to be honest with you, it is hard to spot wealth. Many wealthy men I met are very low key. He might have 50 mil and if he walks pass you, you wouldn\u2019t know. \n\nI met this guy recently in another country. He looks very ordinary. Okay, he drives Maserati but many lawyers with a good salary can afford it too. Hotel is St Regis in Singapore (okay, one K per night but only for 12 days, a lawyer can afford that too)\u2026 \n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t matter where we go, he can find a private car park in a condominium building especially in the areas rich people live. The first time he randomly drove in a building and parked his car, I said \u201c I don\u2019t think we can park here, it says private parking 24/7 tow away\u201d, he replied : my friend is away so I can use his car park; then it happened again, he replied : my friend owns an apartment here but he doesn\u2019t have a car so I can use his Carpark temporarily. \u201c \n\nDude, why don\u2019t you just tell me you own them all? \ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude49 \n\nSo all the apartments add up, it\u2019s much more than 10 mil. That even factors in he\u2019s got a mortgage on every single of them. But I doubt he has. Not a risk taker, this guy, doesn\u2019t believe in crypto and told me not to touch it either. Guess he\u2019s putting most of his money in properties. \n\nPeople with 50 mil tell you they only have 10 mil. It\u2019s usually the case. \n\nJust like I often tell my friends I have an office job 8:30-5 and I have a mortgage on my place. Neither is true.",

Of course my buddy played nice for the rest of the date, stayed cordial and then never returned her calls. Now the irony is he not only owned that apartment but owned that entire building and 2 more similar muti tenant buildngs in the area. Is an early investor in some big tech companies, so he is HNW by very standard. The lady was apparently between jobs and staying with roommates. Wealth reading is a tough skill. To your point, those who have it, will hesitate to show it.\n\nI am not sure how OP would have managed someone like my buddy who almost never wants to show his cards.

I focus on showing how one might be able to understand financial behaviors without/before entering explicit negotiations, and I mention that it just covers only this one of many components at the top of the vetting section. \n\nYes some of the observations I would make are superficial, but if you read carefully, I\u2019m actually asking questions about their experience, relationships and interests, and presenting ways that one could infer valuable information from his responses.\n\nI included some tips that I employe for a first date, as well as my character and profile descriptions, but there are plenty of resources on this sub and elsewhere that cover more accurately and emphatically what a SD is looking for (and perhaps that comes best from a SD rather than me).\n\nThis is meant to be a resource for the SBs vetting of the SD (a resource less scarce but very valuable to a SB with lesser experience), which, as you say and I agree with, is only part of the path to the couple\u2019s success.

To clarify those are abhorrent personality characteristics that drive away decent human beings and the vast majority (not all) of successful people.  If you said smart, aggressive, business savvy, manipulative if needed, and a salesman I would have said those make you rich.  Those are not wealth building characteristics but everyone has different moral values. \n\nBut hey if that's wha't behind the SB business model just stick with married men who you know will cheat.  Questionable morals anyway.  Just don't be one of the SB's who embraces immorality and prioritizes money only.  I knew 2 that thought they were smart and tried to blackmail or extort money from a few different SD's (usually married) one of them being me but I'm single so they picked the wrong guy.

I'm curious the average age now.  However successful men who fit your profile almost all have big ego's and do not like to share For them to be ok with you being with multiple other men, but at the same time saying you love them all (which you wrote somewhere in this thread), and finally having a BF whom you care about more who is ok with all of this seems very very far fetched",

I definitely had a late glow up in life, and can 100% tell the difference in how I'm treated (in both good and bad ways).\n\nThe most impactful improvements for me were:\n\n\\- Losing weight, but staying toned (keeping a butt)\n\n\\- Having an intentional style. A few people in here strongly disliked the \"chopsticks in hair\" comment, but the fact is, the more attention you gain overall, the more negative attention you gain as well. I have a lot of fun with my style. I take an idea/theme that's related to whatever it is I'm dressing up for, I think about what it would look like on stage or on the runway, then I dial it back by 30%. Its fun and playful for me, and SDs (and everyone) really appreciate both the unique style and how much I enjoy playing with it.\n\n\\- Moderate facial cosmetic procedures. I have lip filler (but I keep it light. 1/2 a syringe once a year), and a size small chin implant. The proportions of my face are now more elegant/sexy than cute (which they were more like before).\n\n\\- Going blonde. I have basically black hair naturally and an olive complexion, and never before in my life considered going blonde. I was playing around with FaceApp (a computer vision app you can download from the App Store), and made my hair different colors to see how it'd look, and blonde REALLY worked for me! I encourage everyone to try it out. Interestingly, a tamer blonde looks TERRIBLE on me (washes me out), but pushing past that into platinum changed the game completely. I get comments every single time I go out in public. One time a waiter even \\*\\*bowed down\\*\\* (yeah i know, it was a weird, dorky thing to do, but still really sweet.) to me at a restaurant saying \"omg you're hair!\". The light blonde can also flatter your figure, as it draws the eye up to the face, and contrasts less against your face  (making your head appear larger with respect to your body). The only downside is that it's extremely high maintenance. I'm in the chair ever month for hours, and every time I wash my hair (1-2x a week) I need to apply several products and style it or it looks very messy (damaged)\n\nFor those reading this comment, here is a helpful resource that I've used understanding aesthetic beauty: [Architypes 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vindicta/comments/m0uc3z/update_to_my_achetypes_post_im_still_working_on/), [Architypes 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vindicta/comments/m366jf/the_faces_of_the_archetypes_i_made_a_few_changes/)",

There're all kinds of interests someone could invest money in, and those interests are worth sharing and talking about if they are something you really care about right?\"\n\nThis means that they're SPENDING (thanks boston\\_prof) money on something that is growing in value as they care for it. If someone is investing in their interests in cars, they might be collecting them (the example you gave). If they're investing in some other interest, a relationship for example, then then might be SPENDING on assets or activities that improve the quality and longevity of that relationship.

This is my process, and maybe there is more that I\u2019m doing that I\u2019m not realizing in terms of vetting, but this process works for me.

These examples can help me better myself and more importantly, help members of this community.  \n\nLet\u2019s focus on a solution. Show me how you\u2019d do it better.

I am reasonably attractive and I have money too. \n\nA guy with 10 mil is able to give me a beautiful experience which I expect comfortably. \n\nAnd to be honest with you, it is hard to spot wealth. Many wealthy men I met are very low key. He might have 50 mil and if he walks pass you, you wouldn\u2019t know. \n\nI met this guy recently in another country. He looks very ordinary. Okay, he drives Maserati but many lawyers with a good salary can afford it too. Hotel is St Regis in Singapore (okay, one K per night but only for 12 days, a lawyer can afford that too)\u2026 \n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t matter where we go, he can find a private car park in a condominium building especially in the areas rich people live. The first time he randomly drove in a building and parked his car, I said \u201c I don\u2019t think we can park here, it says private parking 24/7 tow away\u201d, he replied : my friend is away so I can use his car park; then it happened again, he replied : my friend owns an apartment here but he doesn\u2019t have a car so I can use his Carpark temporarily. \u201c \n\nDude, why don\u2019t you just tell me you own them all? \ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude49 \n\nSo all the apartments add up, it\u2019s much more than 10 mil. That even factors in he\u2019s got a mortgage on every single of them. But I doubt he has. Not a risk taker, this guy, doesn\u2019t believe in crypto and told me not to touch it either. Guess he\u2019s putting most of his money in properties. \n\nPeople with 50 mil tell you they only have 10 mil. It\u2019s usually the case. \n\nJust like I often tell my friends I have an office job 8:30-5 and I have a mortgage on my place. Neither is true.",

Of course my buddy played nice for the rest of the date, stayed cordial and then never returned her calls. Now the irony is he not only owned that apartment but owned that entire building and 2 more similar muti tenant buildngs in the area.

To your point, those who have it, will hesitate to show it.\n\nI am not sure how OP would have managed someone like my buddy who almost never wants to show his cards.

So you want us to believe that in less than a year, with no prior experience in the bowl, you have managed to find 'several' SDs, that only 5% get through your vetting process, are giving you mid-4 figures monthly allowances to meet just one per month.\n\nThe details just don't add up.",

To clarify those are abhorrent personality characteristics that drive away decent human beings and the vast majority (not all) of successful people.  If you said smart, aggressive, business savvy, manipulative if needed, and a salesman I would have said those make you rich.  Those are not wealth building characteristics but everyone has different moral values. \n\nBut hey if that's wha't behind the SB business model just stick with married men who you know will cheat.  Questionable morals anyway.  Just don't be one of the SB's who embraces immorality and prioritizes money only.  I knew 2 that thought they were smart and tried to blackmail or extort money from a few different SD's (usually married) one of them being me but I'm single so they picked the wrong guy.

There're all kinds of interests someone could invest money in, and those interests are worth sharing and talking about if they are something you really care about right?\"\n\nThis means that they're SPENDING (thanks boston\\_prof) money on something that is growing in value as they care for it. If someone is investing in their interests in cars, they might be collecting them (the example you gave). If they're investing in some other interest, a relationship for example, then then might be SPENDING on assets or activities that improve the quality and longevity of that relationship.

As long as the dude is clear that he can meet your allowance expectations, that is where you ought to optimize. To do financial root canal on what you think the guy's balance sheet is or how many kids he has etc. is plain naive. For example he may appear wealthy and have no kids but has 3 other expensive SBs'. How are you to know? Or his Linkedin profile tells you he is a high earner but he is actually going through a very expensive divorce and has a civil law suit he is fighting on the business side. How would you know. My point is make the allowance the bedrock, gauge your chemistry, make a call on how safe and attractive you feel he is and if you guys are going to get along and have fun. If the chemistry is right I am sure the guy will find the dollars for you guys to take trips and buy art.",

I'm lucky enough to have a deep understanding of finances and business, as well as empathy, such that I can navigate a normal conversation (before meeting) and feel more or less confident about someone's financial beliefs and intentions.

Of course my buddy played nice for the rest of the date, stayed cordial and then never returned her calls.

So you want us to believe that in less than a year, with no prior experience in the bowl, you have managed to find 'several' SDs, that only 5% get through your vetting process, are giving you mid-4 figures monthly allowances to meet just one per month.\n\nThe details just don't add up.",

To clarify those are abhorrent personality characteristics that drive away decent human beings and the vast majority (not all) of successful people.  If you said smart, aggressive, business savvy, manipulative if needed, and a salesman I would have said those make you rich.  Those are not wealth building characteristics but everyone has different moral values. \n\nBut hey if that's wha't behind the SB business model just stick with married men who you know will cheat.  Questionable morals anyway.  Just don't be one of the SB's who embraces immorality and prioritizes money only.  I knew 2 that thought they were smart and tried to blackmail or extort money from a few different SD's (usually married) one of them being me but I'm single so they picked the wrong guy.

I'm happy to revert my phrasing for clarity, but investing in your happiness or your loved ones IS acceptable verbiage in the english language, and the way I used it is exactly the way in which I meant to use it.\n\nI said \"cars is just an example. There're all kinds of interests someone could invest money in, and those interests are worth sharing and talking about if they are something you really care about right?\"\n\nThis means that they're SPENDING (thanks boston\\_prof) money on something that is growing in value as they care for it. If someone is investing in their interests in cars, they might be collecting them (the example you gave). If they're investing in some other interest, a relationship for example, then then might be SPENDING on assets or activities that improve the quality and longevity of that relationship. And the \\*intention\\* of this sentence was to exemplify the range of observable spending habits.\n\nI'm assuming the pedanticism comes from an honest misunderstanding, but this phrasing is very common in the US where I'm from.",

Those are not wealth building characteristics but everyone has different moral values. \n\nBut hey if that's wha't behind the SB business model just stick with married men who you know will cheat.  Questionable morals anyway.  Just don't be one of the SB's who embraces immorality and prioritizes money only.

There're all kinds of interests someone could invest money in, and those interests are worth sharing and talking about if they are something you really care about right?\"\n\nThis means that they're SPENDING (thanks boston\\_prof) money on something that is growing in value as they care for it. If someone is investing in their interests in cars, they might be collecting them (the example you gave). If they're investing in some other interest, a relationship for example, then then might be SPENDING on assets or activities that improve the quality and longevity of that relationship. And the \\*intention\\* of this sentence was to exemplify the range of observable spending habits.\n\nI'm assuming the pedanticism comes from an honest misunderstanding, but this phrasing is very common in the US where I'm from.",

I\u2019m open to changing myself, but not just because you feel I\u2019m not right. Let\u2019s have productive discourse on a topic which I can see we both obviously really care about.",

As long as the dude is clear that he can meet your allowance expectations, that is where you ought to optimize. To do financial root canal on what you think the guy's balance sheet is or how many kids he has etc. is plain naive. For example he may appear wealthy and have no kids but has 3 other expensive SBs'. How are you to know? Or his Linkedin profile tells you he is a high earner but he is actually going through a very expensive divorce and has a civil law suit he is fighting on the business side. How would you know. My point is make the allowance the bedrock, gauge your chemistry, make a call on how safe and attractive you feel he is and if you guys are going to get along and have fun. If the chemistry is right I am sure the guy will find the dollars for you guys to take trips and buy art.",

I'm lucky enough to have a deep understanding of finances and business, as well as empathy, such that I can navigate a normal conversation (before meeting) and feel more or less confident about someone's financial beliefs and intentions. It's more of a litmus test than a root canal.\n\nEven if there are hidden gems out there, I believe I would simply spend too much time giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, which would prevent me from finding a compatible SD.",

To clarify those are abhorrent personality characteristics that drive away decent human beings and the vast majority (not all) of successful people.

Those are not wealth building characteristics but everyone has different moral values. \n\nBut hey if that's wha't behind the SB business model just stick with married men who you know will cheat.  Questionable morals anyway.  Just don't be one of the SB's who embraces immorality and prioritizes money only.  I knew 2 that thought they were smart and tried to blackmail or extort money from a few different SD's (usually married) one of them being me but I'm single so they picked the wrong guy.

Those are not wealth building characteristics but everyone has different moral values. \n\nBut hey if that's wha't behind the SB business model just stick with married men who you know will cheat.  Questionable morals anyway.  Just don't be one of the SB's who embraces immorality and prioritizes money only.

But I know plenty of people who have been to Paris ONCE that too fully funded by their company and would tell you shit like they were actually born and lived there and even own half of the city if that is what they feel you want to hear.
