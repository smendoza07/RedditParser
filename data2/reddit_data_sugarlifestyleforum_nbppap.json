    "body": "I went on a lunch date today with a very nice POT I had been talking to for a few days. He genuinely seemed nice and caring over text and we spent hours talking, absolutely hit it off. \n\nAfter the date ended and we went our separate ways, I went shopping for work clothes that I desperately need. I pick some out and head to the changerooms to try them on and when I'm halfway undressed he opens the curtain and comes into the changeroom with me. He pushed himself onto me and kissed me, felt me, the whole nine. I was completely taken aback cause he would have had to be following me for 20 or so minutes. At that point I had only ever kissed one guy and just felt so disgusted and unsafe. Tonight I deleted my SA account and am not looking back. I know there are nice guys but I can't deal with the bad ones in order to get to them.",

In the eyes of the law, sugar babies are just a breath away from sex workers and that makes us vulnerable as any sex worker is, and some men prey on us knowing we can't easily go to cops about this. There used to be (and prolly still are somewhere) whole forums of men figuring out how to scam sugar babies out of free sex and at worst, there were even men sharing stories of straight up raping sugar babies. Sex workers are vulnerable to sexual assault and if you can get ahead in life another way, it really seems like that might be best for you.  \n\n\nIt's a huge problem that social media seems to advertise the glamour of sex workers and sugaring while hiding all the very real dangers we face. The truth is many women in this lifestyle have faced sexual assault and many won't talk about it in order to not drive away potential clientele who are made uncomfortable by facing that type of situation. I know for sure I NEVER speak about sexual assault I've faced with any men because it is a way to lose myself money, and because they can't do anything about what I've faced anyway. SW who are online are ALWAYS marketing, you have to remember that, so they will never ever mention the negatives of any of it and many don't realize that this lifestyle and everything adjacent to it is highly dangerous. I hope you're ok, and I absolutely do not blame you for what happened, but I really think you deserve to know the reality that lies behind this lifestyle and really evaluate if it's for you.",

Reporting sexual assault is even worse. Throw in sex work (or at least sex work adjacent) being what led the perp to you and the complainant will basically be the one on trial. Not as in she will be put in jail - that is a thing of the past in most places. Rather the victim will have their entire sexual history exposed, Crown and police will be skeptical to even start prosecuting/investigating the guy, going through court will mean exposing so much personal information and shame, and sometimes nothing comes of it. It is an incredibly dangerous world, especially for women.",

Reporting sexual assault is even worse. Throw in sex work (or at least sex work adjacent) being what led the perp to you and the complainant will basically be the one on trial. Not as in she will be put in jail - that is a thing of the past in most places. Rather the victim will have their entire sexual history exposed, Crown and police will be skeptical to even start prosecuting/investigating the guy, going through court will mean exposing so much personal information and shame, and sometimes nothing comes of it. It is an incredibly dangerous world, especially for women.",

If you're a SW who wants to avoid any contact with the law, some will pass up reporting to keep themselves from having to answer too many questions from police. There is a chance that their previous text or email interactions contained info that could be damning for her or get her arrested. There are many situations that might cause a sugar baby not to report an assault at all. I'm not convinced that one has a black or white \"yes you can\" or \"no you can't\" answer.",

Throw in sex work (or at least sex work adjacent) being what led the perp to you and the complainant will basically be the one on trial. Not as in she will be put in jail - that is a thing of the past in most places. Rather the victim will have their entire sexual history exposed, Crown and police will be skeptical to even start prosecuting/investigating the guy, going through court will mean exposing so much personal information and shame, and sometimes nothing comes of it.

Throw in sex work (or at least sex work adjacent) being what led the perp to you and the complainant will basically be the one on trial. Not as in she will be put in jail - that is a thing of the past in most places. Rather the victim will have their entire sexual history exposed, Crown and police will be skeptical to even start prosecuting/investigating the guy, going through court will mean exposing so much personal information and shame, and sometimes nothing comes of it.

If you're a SW who wants to avoid any contact with the law, some will pass up reporting to keep themselves from having to answer too many questions from police. There is a chance that their previous text or email interactions contained info that could be damning for her or get her arrested. There are many situations that might cause a sugar baby not to report an assault at all. I'm not convinced that one has a black or white \"yes you can\" or \"no you can't\" answer.",

Throw in sex work (or at least sex work adjacent) being what led the perp to you and the complainant will basically be the one on trial. Not as in she will be put in jail - that is a thing of the past in most places. Rather the victim will have their entire sexual history exposed, Crown and police will be skeptical to even start prosecuting/investigating the guy, going through court will mean exposing so much personal information and shame, and sometimes nothing comes of it. It is an incredibly dangerous world, especially for women.",
