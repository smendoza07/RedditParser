Not only did they cross the river, but successfully completed the task within the time limit.\n\nIn another boat, there was Kim Jong Koo, Gary, Lee Kwang Soo, and Yoo Jae Suk. They drowned in the middle of the river. But they made it back to the shore, started once again in the same boat, and ultimately made it to the opposite bank.\n\nThe moment Ji Hyo took down the flag, I also cried in delight, along with her.\n\nIncredible episode. An all-time best.\n\nYouTube link of this task.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfOk0U9OUK0&t=1425s&ab\\_channel=sNack%21",
