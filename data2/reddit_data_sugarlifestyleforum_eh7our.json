    "body": "So, my SB is having trouble finding the valet parking. I have no idea what kind of car she drives, but I'm outside, on the phone with her, trying to help explain where to go.  I see what I think is her car in front of the hotel, and she is reaching into the back seat of the car for some reason.  So I walk up and tap on the glass. Well, it wasn't my SB. It was a person I would describe as \"someone's grandma.\" \n#\nFor my non-American friends out there:  In the USA, if a stranger taps on the window of your car, you are constitutionally obligated to take your travel gun, and fire a clip at that person, while screaming \"McDonalds!\" as loudly as you can.  To my surprise, the woman smiled and waved at me.  Clearly, she either didn't go to public school, or has a thing for a poorly regulated militia, because I'm still alive. \n#\nI walk down the street still on the phone with my SB, thinking \"wow, this must be what life is like for good looking guys. She smiled and waved.\"  I hang up with my SB, and look down.  There is a set of keys in my hand.  The woman thought I was the valet, and must have handed me her keys, and I took them without paying attention.  (In LA, its not uncommon for nice hotels to have a valet in a suit or tux).  Great.  Now I have accidentally carjacked someone again. \n#\nShe is no where in sight, and her car is parked illegally. So I get in her car, and drive it to the valet stand.  The conversation went like this:\n#\nValet:  \"Sir, are you parking overnight?\"\n#\nMe:  \"Oh, I don't know.  This isn't my car.\"\n#\nValet:  \"The car you are sitting in.... um.. whose car is it?\"\n#\nMe:  \"Oh, I don't know that either. Some older Asian chick in a pink blazer.\"\n#\nMy SB pulls up, and it takes about 15 minutes to clear up all the confusion. Finally, I'm walking into the hotel, telling my girl we have to look for this woman, so she knows where her car is parked.  My SB is very amused.  She says:  \"I mean, you did park her car, so technically, she did give it to the valet...\"  I tell her:  \"Yeah, but I didn't do it for cash. I only park cars for ass.\" I'm saying this as we walk in, and who is sitting there?  The woman with what I believe is her entire family.  So I see her, and I'm so happy, I say:  \"Oh Hey!  I parked your car!\"\n#\nMore confusion ensues, but after many minutes, I think that everyone understands that I won't park your car, regardless of the currency offered.  However; if you happen to be offering sex, among the many services I am willing to provide, is parking your car.\n#\nThe lady never says a word this entire time. It was all back and forth with a guy that looked like her grandson. So finally, we are all straightened out, and the guy is thanking me, and I say: \"Ah, don't worry about your grandma. I'm used to strange women giving me stuff.  Normally, its Chlamydia though, not a car.\"  I laugh.  My SB laughs.  No one else laughs. Instead, the guy gives me the finger guns, and says:  \"That's my wife.\"\n#\nThe story of my whole life, is that the minute I am about to become the hero, I tell just one more joke and it always ends up to be a funeral, or I really did sleep with that kid's mom back when she was alive and had weight problems.
