You're right in that there isn't really a logical reason for a lot the stuff in that arc. \n\n\n\n\nLike, it makes no sense for sakura to have a picture of sasuke in an Akatsuki robe in the first place, and even if she did, it makes no sense for her to frame it. \n\n\nI find it much easier to just ignore that kind of bullshit and just enjoy the what they're trying to do lol",

However, him not coming home for 10 years is nothing short of stupid. He definitely has the means and for him to be gone *long* without even a letter doesn't make any sense.\n\n>Naruto and Sasuke had never heard of Madara until Kurama mentioned him, does the academy not have history class?

You're right in that there isn't really a logical reason for a lot the stuff in that arc. \n\n\n\n\nLike, it makes no sense for sakura to have a picture of sasuke in an Akatsuki robe in the first place, and even if she did, it makes no sense for her to frame it. \n\n\nI find it much easier to just ignore that kind of bullshit and just enjoy the what they're trying to do lol",

However, him not coming home for 10 years is nothing short of stupid. He definitely has the means and for him to be gone *long* without even a letter doesn't make any sense.\n\n>Naruto and Sasuke had never heard of Madara until Kurama mentioned him, does the academy not have history class?

You're right in that there isn't really a logical reason for a lot the stuff in that arc. \n\n\n\n\nLike, it makes no sense for sakura to have a picture of sasuke in an Akatsuki robe in the first place, and even if she did, it makes no sense for her to frame it. \n\n\nI find it much easier to just ignore that kind of bullshit and just enjoy the what they're trying to do lol",

However, him not coming home for 10 years is nothing short of stupid. He definitely has the means and for him to be gone *long* without even a letter doesn't make any sense.\n\n>Naruto and Sasuke had never heard of Madara until Kurama mentioned him, does the academy not have history class?

However, him not coming home for 10 years is nothing short of stupid. He definitely has the means and for him to be gone *long* without even a letter doesn't make any sense.\n\n>Naruto and Sasuke had never heard of Madara until Kurama mentioned him, does the academy not have history class? It hits hard when Itachi tells Sasuke that was his partner though.\n\nTbf the leaf probably hid things like that. Like how info on the Uchiha clan is restricted now in boruto.\n\n>I kind of wish they'd taken that route, it would have been a lot more interesting.\n\nYeah but I think they want sasuke to be the one to tell her and create an emotional scene from it",

However, him not coming home for 10 years is nothing short of stupid. He definitely has the means and for him to be gone *long* without even a letter doesn't make any sense.\n\n>Naruto and Sasuke had never heard of Madara until Kurama mentioned him, does the academy not have history class?

However, him not coming home for 10 years is nothing short of stupid. He definitely has the means and for him to be gone *long* without even a letter doesn't make any sense.\n\n>Naruto and Sasuke had never heard of Madara until Kurama mentioned him, does the academy not have history class?

However, him not coming home for 10 years is nothing short of stupid. He definitely has the means and for him to be gone *long* without even a letter doesn't make any sense.\n\n>Naruto and Sasuke had never heard of Madara until Kurama mentioned him, does the academy not have history class?

You're right in that there isn't really a logical reason for a lot the stuff in that arc. \n\n\n\n\nLike, it makes no sense for sakura to have a picture of sasuke in an Akatsuki robe in the first place, and even if she did, it makes no sense for her to frame it. \n\n\nI find it much easier to just ignore that kind of bullshit and just enjoy the what they're trying to do lol",
