    "body": "I\u2019m an SB f 30s. I have NEVER faked an orgasm, and I don\u2019t want to start. I believe it reinforces false signals of pleasure which is to no ones benefit in the long run. However, I\u2019ve noticed a fair percentage of SDs are obsessed with when I cum, and they want that to happen with magic... I\u2019m assuming. \n\nAfter no foreplay and 10 minutes of PIV, there is no way I\u2019m going to be able to orgasm. Yet, men ask me, \u201cOh bb are you going to cum for me?\u201d Firstly, that question ruins any chance I did have of having an orgasm. Secondly, it\u2019s ignorant to think that women can cum that quickly. Have all their previous partners faked orgasms? \n\nFYI, I have no difficulties reaching orgasm. I normally have \u201cwave orgasms,\u201d they take longer to get to, but they are mind blowing. \n\n1. SBs, do you fake your orgasms, and if so, for what reason or to what end?\n2. SDs, do you care if your SB fakes her orgasms? Can you tell? Can you enjoy intimacy if your partner does not orgasm?",

Same as if we are in a warm car? \n\nOr do I just tell her to do a quick workout? Is a 20 minute walk ok? What if it is cold outside? Should I get her a treadmill? \n\nCan I speed things up be wrapping her in a blanket and getting her to run on the treadmill for 5 minutes?\n\nWhat about microwaving, can I put her in on high and get her warm in 1 minute?\n\nWhat if she gets too hot, will by dick get burnt?\n\nPlease help an old man.",

Please take note, sex feels better with lube for women which means it feels better for you. Women\u2019s vaginal tissue is delicate, and has a very delicate balance. Lube is a layer of protection, and it also helps reduce pain sensations during sex for women who often experience pain during sex (even very pleasurable sex). \n\nIf a lover doesn\u2019t have lube by the bed on offer for his guest, I take note...and it\u2019s not a good note. I also bring my own preferred lube and condoms with me :)",

I also think touching yourself during intercourse is a great idea because you don\u2019t have to intro a toy, it\u2019s sexy, it feels for you, and of course for most women orgasm is more easily achieved with direct clitoral stimulation. Seeing you orgasm may turn his attention. You can talk during sex, and show him what feels good for you. \n\nYou could also masturbate in front of him as a treat. Watching how you touch yourself will be exciting and a good lesson for him. \n\nI orgasm most easily on my knees, bent over with my chest and head on the bed in front of me, and my hand on my clit. Also, cowgirl while he is seated is excellent and gives me a lot of control, no clitoral stimulation needed for me in this position.",

You generally get pretty good oral in return... \n\nI don't know if there is any study on it, but.. It has worked anytime in my experience. \n\nMake sure to LET YOUR SD KNOW that you want to enjoy yourself as much as they are, so if they want you to REALLY enjoy yourself.. They have to put in some extra work. \n\nMost men I have met in the bowl are big fans of giving oral, so... Just ask.. I am SURE he would be happy to do a little extra to ensure you aren't faking it.\n\n**Note:  Came back to add: BRING A VIBRATOR/TOY to your next intimate date... Make it fun..

I've had several recent encounters with a new SB and even though she gets very close to orgasm with both oral and penile penetration, she seems to be holding back a bit at the last moment.  I usually spend at least 15-20 minutes giving her oral, kissing her, etc.  which seems to get her juices flowing quite nicely, before attempting to enter her.  She is quite loud, which I love and her flushed face and cervical contractions would probably be difficult to fake.  My question to other SBs is this:  Is this a common thing for an SB to hold back an orgasm in order not to get too emotionally involved with an SD?  Or perhaps she just needs more time to completely \"let go\" and trust.  This SB is in the middle of a difficult divorce with kids involved, and being that I'm also in the process of separating from my wife, I'm trying to go really slow with her.  \n\nI love the passion and intimacy this woman provides and I would definitely not want her to fake anything!",

There are some signals that are too difficult to fake all together: flushing, involuntary muscle contractions, pupil dilation, etc. She has two kinds of orgasms, and I can feel both happening, and the second type are pretty intense but not overacted at all. Plus she wants to fuck despite knowing she\u2019ll get paid either way. \n\nThat being said, I\u2019ve had a variety with previous partners, both SB and vanilla. One girl I was with for a few months would get super close to cumming, and then would suddenly just scooch away and stop fucking to keep herself from cumming with me, which was highly frustrating. I think she had intimacy issues.  A vanilla ex GF faked all the time and I could tell, totally turn off. Be honest ladies, if you have trouble cumming, that\u2019s fine, but let us know!  But I think most of my SB\u2019s have actually came, although I\u2019m extra attentive to my partner\u2019s needs, give lots of foreplay, lots of intimacy and closeness (physical and emotional) and am pretty large but also careful not to hurt anyone, so I don\u2019t get too many complaints haha.",

I would hope that by the time a man is old enough (late 30s+?) to be a SD, and probably successful in many parts of life, then he knows some basic rules about lovemaking. The basics:\n1) All women are different and it takes time to learn what any individual likes\n2) Foreplay is very important\n3) Some women climax only from penetration; some need C stimulation; some need a lot of attention from your mouth or fingers first; and some women never orgasm during sex. Some women are easy to figure out, and are a type; some take a LONG time to understand, and are challenging. \n\nIt\u2019s important for me that my partner orgasms, or at least enjoys sex as some women cannot or do not orgasm during sex but enjoy it; but that\u2019s largely MY responsibility. And if it\u2019s not happening then I need to study up! And learn more about her. Some failure can be fine because we can learn from failure. Success comes from failure! But chronic and endless failure is inexcusable. \n\nSo to answer the question, I don\u2019t want my partner to fake her orgasm because if I\u2019m underperforming I need to know. I think I can tell and I think I\u2019m very empathetic and sensitive to my partners need. I do want my partner to orgasm and I\u2019ll do what it takes if I like her.",

I communicate with all my partners that I want them to have a fantastic time and I'm happy to listen to feedback on how to make that happen. I prefer lots of foreplay anyway so that's not a problem. The only non-negotiable for me is be honest about what you want and need. There is no way I'm going to give you an orgasm? Ok! You are still going to have a great time? Ok!

(Unless she's into that kinda thing, but I would guess you've made her cum PLENTY to know that she is satisfied and can back up that statement...)\n\nWomen don't orgasm like men. Don't expect all of then to shoot coochie juice at you from across the room when they orgasm.",

Doesn't mean that leading up to said orgasm doesn't still feel really good for us. \n\nMen have... Ahem... Visual \"pleasing\" orgasms... But, women don't, usually, have those. Hence, why men have become so obsessed with women \"squirting\".. It's the equivalent of the \"female visually pleasing orgasm\".. It's satisfying to see your partner get to that point..\n\nBut, just because a woman \"squirts\" does not necessarily mean they orgasm ...same way just bc a woman has an orgasm it doesn't mean it's going to be a \"squirting orgasm\"...\n\nIt's a completely different sensation and experience for women than for men... Plus... Not to mention it is a very hard thing to achieve for most women esp. Ones that are new partners, nervous, inexperienced etc.  \n\nI had sex for 5 or 6 years before I had an actual \"REAL Orgasm\" and given that most SBs are in the 18-25 range.. It would not, at all, be surprising for them to have had sex plenty of times but never had an amazing and full body orgasm.\n \n\nI dunno...

Men who think women who need lube aren\u2019t turned on, or take it as an affront to their manhood are mistaken. Please take note, sex feels better with lube for women which means it feels better for you. Women\u2019s vaginal tissue is delicate, and has a very delicate balance. Lube is a layer of protection, and it also helps reduce pain sensations during sex for women who often experience pain during sex (even very pleasurable sex). \n\nIf a lover doesn\u2019t have lube by the bed on offer for his guest, I take note...and it\u2019s not a good note. I also bring my own preferred lube and condoms with me :)",

Watching how you touch yourself will be exciting and a good lesson for him. \n\nI orgasm most easily on my knees, bent over with my chest and head on the bed in front of me, and my hand on my clit. Also, cowgirl while he is seated is excellent and gives me a lot of control, no clitoral stimulation needed for me in this position.",

Hence, why men have become so obsessed with women \"squirting\".. It's the equivalent of the \"female visually pleasing orgasm\".. It's satisfying to see your partner get to that point..\n\nBut, just because a woman \"squirts\" does not necessarily mean they orgasm ...same way just bc a woman has an orgasm it doesn't mean it's going to be a \"squirting orgasm\"...\n\nIt's a completely different sensation and experience for women than for men...

Ones that are new partners, nervous, inexperienced etc.  \n\nI had sex for 5 or 6 years before I had an actual \"REAL Orgasm\" and given that most SBs are in the 18-25 range..

Doesn't mean that leading up to said orgasm doesn't still feel really good for us. \n\nMen have... Ahem... Visual \"pleasing\" orgasms... But, women don't, usually, have those. Hence, why men have become so obsessed with women \"squirting\".. It's the equivalent of the \"female visually pleasing orgasm\".. It's satisfying to see your partner get to that point..\n\nBut, just because a woman \"squirts\" does not necessarily mean they orgasm ...same way just bc a woman has an orgasm it doesn't mean it's going to be a \"squirting orgasm\"...\n\nIt's a completely different sensation and experience for women than for men... Plus... Not to mention it is a very hard thing to achieve for most women esp. Ones that are new partners, nervous, inexperienced etc.  \n\nI had sex for 5 or 6 years before I had an actual \"REAL Orgasm\" and given that most SBs are in the 18-25 range.. It would not, at all, be surprising for them to have had sex plenty of times but never had an amazing and full body orgasm.\n \n\nI dunno...

Doesn't mean that leading up to said orgasm doesn't still feel really good for us. \n\nMen have... Ahem... Visual \"pleasing\" orgasms... But, women don't, usually, have those. Hence, why men have become so obsessed with women \"squirting\".. It's the equivalent of the \"female visually pleasing orgasm\".. It's satisfying to see your partner get to that point..\n\nBut, just because a woman \"squirts\" does not necessarily mean they orgasm ...same way just bc a woman has an orgasm it doesn't mean it's going to be a \"squirting orgasm\"...\n\nIt's a completely different sensation and experience for women than for men... Plus... Not to mention it is a very hard thing to achieve for most women esp. Ones that are new partners, nervous, inexperienced etc.  \n\nI had sex for 5 or 6 years before I had an actual \"REAL Orgasm\" and given that most SBs are in the 18-25 range.. It would not, at all, be surprising for them to have had sex plenty of times but never had an amazing and full body orgasm.\n \n\nI dunno...

The OP was speaking on no foreplay and 10 mins of sex and having to fake the orgasm that comes with THAT kind of sex...and that sounds like Hell to me.. \n\nI have never had a man NOT ask me if I had an orgasm.. Bc to them, they want to be sure you \"got off\", too.. I don't think it's really that odd of a question bc a man gets off... You know.. \n\nBut.. Female orgasms are just different than their's so.. Like women... It just isn't ALWAYS a \"Yes/no\" answer... \n\nI have had some awesome sex and not had an orgasm.. Doesn't mean it wasn't amazing and I am going to be grumpy and kicking rocks bc I didn't get one..",
