    "body": "Why do happily married men cheat?  My SD is happily married with kids, but still seeks me out.      Don\u2019t understand why.  His wife is attractive.  I\u2019m feeling super guilty and oddly I\u2019d feel better if he just told me he was in a dead bedroom.  Makes me feel scared to ever get married myself.  Don\u2019t understand how he can have unprotected sex with me and then go to his wife?!?!  On social media, his life and family look perfect.  Just makes me so hesitant to get into a real relationship.  I feel like I\u2019ll never be able to trust a man.",

            "body": "I can totally relate. Now (8 months into sugaring ) I feel like my idea of marriage and love is kinda tainted or at the very least, modified. One of my SD is married, always talks endearingly about his wife and kids which I genuinely enjoy. He also talks about how our arrangement solely exists bc things in the bedroom with his wife are kinda non existent. In part I came to terms with the fact that maybe An arrangement is what\u2019s best for his marriage...BUT There\u2019s the other part of me that wonders if this will happen to me one day. \nIt\u2019s not a constant thought but definitely has crossed my mind.",

I have a good friend who is recently divorced great guy, fun, business owner, he will give you the shirt off his back, was married 25 years, wife has only slept with him a few times in last 4 years and hasn\u2019t given a BJ in 15 years. So you can understand because he looks like a happy family on social media doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s basically in a platonic relationship where he\u2019s supporting his wife because he loves her as a person but is no longer in love with her because she has cut that part of herself off",

Or have open discussions with a counselor. \n\nCheating men who blame their partners make it seem like their partners have outsized power to 'keep' them. The truth is less complicated. \n\nI have been with SDs who have the 'perfect' marriage with ample sex and vacation. One had stay at home wife, one had career wife, etc. Sometimes, at the end of the day, it matters less what the wife does or who she is as a person. A man wants to cheat because he feels he can, or he likes the rush of manipulation/not getting caught, or he has money and wants a taste of spending it on girls, or he travels a lot and is lonely on the road, etc. You could be the wife fretting and spending your life making sure he doesn't cheat, but that just sounds like too much work. Over time they become 'don't ask don't tell' because money is the ultimate security, over a faithful spouse. \n\nI will say, in my experience, the cheating married SDs have the best mental gymnastics in justifying away their behavior while maintaining the perfect family man du jour image. \n\nTo keep faith while being an SB is hard. But it is true that some people never cheat.",

A lot of us do, and that can make things difficult when we are with people who really like sex. But don't get yourself worked up over it. The more you stress about it, the more you won't want to do it, or won't be able to enjoy it when you do.   \n\n\nI can't say whether your bf will leave you because you don't feel in the mood quite as often as he does. What I can say is that, you should talk to him about why you don't feel like it. Make sure he understands it has nothing to do with your attraction to him, how much you care about him, etc. It's just where you're at in life, and you want to make sure he understands he's loved even if you don't feel like you're keeping up with him sexually. Ask him how he feels about it, instead of assuming the worst that he's going to leave without ever trying to help you or your relationship navigate the obstacle. It's a really hard conversation to have, and I don't know if it will fix anything---but if you have anxiety about it, it's better than letting this feeling and thought fester and become a self fulfilling prophecy.",

I had a couple hot GFs in HS and college, but even then would \"hookup\" (in age/experience appropriate manner) if given a chance. but, for the most part I was NOT the sought after guy in HS or college, so I took whatever action I could get\n\n>Or that it can also happen down the line to anyone, just getting bored with what would make anyone else happy?\n\nyes to this as well. I used to travel for work a lot, and in my mid-20s to early 30s a random hookup wasn't that difficult to accomplish and was a form of entertainment when I had nothing better to do in the evenings.\n\n>I guess I wonder if there is anything that can actually be done to entirely avoid cheating.\n\ndon't know about that.  I certainly don't have any insight, as I cheated on my first ever GF in 6th grade, and have failed monogamy ever since.\n\n>I notice now how he appeals to women who probably wouldn\u2019t have looked at him before\n\nI completely understand this. I was not the sought after guy in college, but when all my ladies' man friends went into entry level jobs and I went straight into management, fancy sports car, expense account, etc then girls from college starting coming up to me and saying \"wow, I probably should have said yes when you asked me out\". of course, my response was \"it's not too late to say yes now\".\n\n>I actually think he would be the type to cheat before admitting he wanted to be open.\n\nI think one of the things people struggle with is the thought that \"cheating on a relationship\" is always a \"threat to the relationship\".  None, zero, nada of the cheating I've done (will do) has ever been a threat to my primary relationship. even if a couple agree to have an open relationship, there is still the possibility your partner will decide they want to replace you with someone they were \"open\" with. just being \"open\" about seeing other people doesn't necessarily protect the relationship.\n\nthe really odd thing that I've discovered since my current SR got pretty serious and went to SBF/SGF status, is that I have been mostly monogamous with my SGF. I say mostly, because there has been other women, but only in threesomes with me and SGF (so she gets to enjoy too). and, one time, I let a stripper do a HJ on me (who ended up becoming one of our threesome girls, so maybe that doesn't count). it doesn't bother me that this has happened - I'm actually pretty happy about it. it just seems really out of character compared with my history.\n\nso, maybe there IS someone out there that would end up not cheating on you, even when there is easy opportunity and no reason not to.",

It could be sex, it could be an ear to listen, a smile they don't get back home, etc... Sugar babies allow men to be happier in their marriage and life.   It's similar to having a therapist.  Would you, future wife/ex sugar baby, begrudge your husband from going to his chiropractor, masseuse, therapist, even though it makes him happy?  Would he not let you go for mani/pedis, spas, shopping, even though it makes you happy?  You need to consider the net result, and not get hung up on how people attain happiness.",

Through this, nobody can be hurt by deception, consent is given no matter what decision is made, and through compromise, everyone can get what they want. As I said in another comment, I'm not at all advocating for divorce, and I'm not saying that any man deserves to be in that situation or should just live with it unhappily. What I said above, an open dialogue, can make a huge difference here. If I was married for so long and I knew that I was having these issues with my husband, I would much rather we have a discussion and come up with a compromise, no matter how painful the situation might be.

An open relationship or no relationship is always on the table (wait to see someone who would agree to open or just be single) and so there are three options. People opt for one of of the two you mentioned for social/cultural reasons and so the cause of *cheating* is social/cultural. A man who would cheat but not allow his wife to see other men is not being driven by biology, he is being driven by his ego. If he was driven purely by his biology he wouldn\u2019t agree to a monogamous relationship to begin with. \n\nImo, of course.",

It's the grown-up equivalent of \"well *everyone* knows _____.\u201d First of all, human psychology is a grossly under researched field (in comparison to physical sciences.) If you didn't read a decent study (decent in this context means, unbiased researchers, proper sample size, recent within the last 5-10 years, and hopefully not the first of its kind) that directly supports the argument, and you weren't an evolutionary biology major, I'm not sure where you're getting the \"well it's just biology\". According to....whom? Your inner thoughts and whatever part of your ass you're pulling facts from? There are certain common sense things I think \"it's just biology\" applies to: colorblind genes being on the y chromosome therefore effect more men than women. But using \"it's just biology\"for the entire existence and reasoning of two genders when humans and the human psyche are extremely complex entities that *no one* fully understands is a bullshit argument. Especially when no one is ever able to submit a source on this opinion (likely because it's a regurgitated fallacy.)\n\n Second of all, blaming biology for shitty behavior is childish at best.

So, for example, human history seems to suggest that monogamous pair-bonding is the expected behavior of humans for the last 10,000 years or so and  it may be useful to understand why. Conversely, history, psychology, and other scientific fields seem to show that humans are TERRIBLE at lifelong monogamy. Again, I think it's interesting to pursue the \"why\" of that. \n\nBut the study of human behavior and its \"whys\" is entirely different from ethics or morality. Those go more under the realm of philosophy or religion. I have an interest in both things. The last four years of my marriage, my wife didn't touch me, much less have sex with me. To this day I think religion fucked us both up in regards to sexuality. I ultimately took the only path I could, divorce, but that path was hard as hell and and created a huge amount of trauma for my kids and extended family that lasted more than 5 years. Now I don't regret getting divorced, but my experience has caused me to have a lot of compassion for men and women in sexless marriages. Our , yes, \"biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to depression and other forms of mental illness. \n\nTo circle back around to where I started, what I want to see is for the whole structure of marriage and the stupid, unrealistic expectation of lifelong monogamy to fucking go away. It doesn't work for the majority of humans. So if \"cheating \" is the least worst option for a person, I support them. I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.",

Biology describes tendencies, it is not a law. I would assume that ethics and morality play bigger parts in cheating and non-monogamy than biology, but since there's 0 research to attest to that, I won't make statements like \"cheating is a moral issue, not biology\"--because it's factually impossible to prove. The same way \"it's just biology\" is factually impossible to prove, and is therefore an incorrect and bullshit statement. I hope this better explains my stance on that statement.   \n\n\n>biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection  is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to  depression and other forms of mental illness.    \n\n\nI very much agree, so it confuses me to read other posters calling an entire gender babies or trash because they have human needs that refuse to be met by partners that supposedly care about them. Open relationships and polyamory aren't for everyone, and I would argue (as a person in an open marriage) that polyamory is not a life-long lifestyle for many people. So unfortunately, just \"leave them or have an open marriage but don't cheat\" is not valid advice.   \n\n\n> I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.    \n\n\nI am always surprised when people my age (mid twenties) get surprised/offended by our decision to be in an open relationship. Even more surprised when women who are entering a relationship with a self-identified married man (my husband) have opinions about the kind of person *I* am for being in an open marriage. Not him, the person they are sleeping with...but the other woman in the relationship.   \n\n\nWhile society has an impact on the views of polyamory and other forms of non-monogamy, I feel as though the onus is on the individuals to stay sane in a relationship. Sane people make better choices for what works best for them, their life, their partner, and their relationship. Non-monogamy as a concept is not a silver bullet, it depends on the individuals entering the relationship to be very clear and supportive with their partners.",

I would just like to point out that a lot more animals are promiscuous than are  monogamous, And that only one species of primate, which is what humans are, is monogamous. All the others, chimps, bonobos, gorillas etc. are promiscuous. Promiscuous, in this context is a scientific term describing animal sexual behavior, not a judgemental thing. I believe and I think the science bears out, that humans did not evolve with a sexuality involving monogamous pairing. There\u2019s a great book on this called Sex at Dawn, by Cacilda Jeth\u00e1 and Christopher Ryan. To enter into a long term relationship or a marriage vowing lifelong monogamy is foolish. I did something even more foolish, I made that vow on my wedding day and had never had sex with my wife. \u201cSaving yourself for marriage\u201d is literally one of the dumbest things that people can do and I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s restricted almost entirely to religious people.",

Do you think there may be instances where infidelity is the least-worst option?

Do you think divorce in that situation is more \"moral\" than infidelity? )\n\nI am divorced / single and don't have any skin in this game so I really am asking philosophically.",

The question here is it ok to lie and deceive the most important person in your life because of some perceived benefit, mostly selfish?  No I don't think so.   Many adults of all ages have not had sex for years.   You won't die from it.   If the hand you're dealt is no more sex,  then no more sex.   Take care of your wife and grow from it.  If you can't handle it, pleasure yourself and use porn.  Because frankly,  f'ing around while your wife is slowly dying is pretty crappy.",

I think most people don't do that because they know deep inside it's a joke.\u201d \n\nThis begs a few questions.  First, are the vows at the ceremony the only ones that matter? The way you phrase it seems to imply that a couple can\u2019t change their agreement after they\u2019ve been married. For example they can\u2019t decide to open their marriage 10 years later. I\u2019m assuming that is not what you\u2019re saying because its a really really dumb idea. I also don\u2019t know what you mean when you say \u201cthey don\u2019t say that at the ceremony because they know deep down inside it\u2019s a joke\u201d. Do you know what\u2019s a joke? 20-somethings making a promise of lifelong monogamy. \n\nI endured four years of literally not beng touched by my wife. And because I didn\u2019t cheat during that time period, but looked at a lot of  porn and whacked off a lot, I feel like an expert on that subject. I know that having no physical touch or sex for years can literally drive you to depression, suicide and near insanity. So when I say something like you have to do whatever you have to do to stay sane and stay married I know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re pretty damn young, probably in your 20s. Because when I was in my 20s I was self-righteous as hell and religious. And I thought I was right about everything. The growth I have experience now that I am in my 50s is all centered around understanding that the world is complex and nuanced. Hopefully you will understand that one day too.",

That one change is probably the most important development in the history of our species. Before then, there was no \"property\", just clans hunting and gathering to survive. There is a lot of evidence that before that event, humans did not pair bond, but rather behaved more like bonobos, with female-directed promiscuity being the norm. There is a lot of evidence for this, including the size and shape of the human penis, studies of modern isolated hunter-gatherer. But once we stopped wandering and started claiming property, it became necessary to be able to know paternity of children, which is how marriage and the concept of ownership of women came about. The truth is, for most of the history of marriage, it was a property contract and the beginning of \"the patriarchy\". Monogamy and marriage fit together like hand and glove. I always find it interesting when women defend marriage. If only they understood the history of the institution.",

Some men want to sow the earth, some men just want to live on their acre undisturbed and happily into their golden years. Men who have the means to sugar, should they fall into the former category, will not likely be faithful. But some men fall in the later category. Stranger still, some of those men also have the means to sugar. Exhibit SD is yours truly.\n\nI will admit that though I had the constitution and the willingness to be faithful, things my ex and I discussed and agreed on effectively drove me to the world of sugar. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is, there exist men who can/will be faithful husbands. If the marriage deteriorated so that one party can\u2019t find something within the marriage, they will seek it elsewhere. It could be anything between validation, compliments/feeling desirable, or sexual release. The trick is to work continuously on nurturing that relationship.",

You know why?\n\nCuz cheaters are gonna cheat, if it's not you, it WOULD be some other girl. Some people are just not content in a traditional marriage and that is NOT your fault.\n\nMy dad was a ladies man, but that never stopped him from taking care of my family. He was so committed and always went above and beyond for our family as well as my mom's extended family. And if he had more love to give, on top of giving his family 200%, who am i to stop him from being his true self?\n\nTBH, I like SD who are happily marriage because they are stable, responsible, and usually very capable.\n\nDon't lose hope in marriage, not all men are like this. I am sure there are still guys that would be perfectly content with just one person<3\n\nI think if anything, the exposure to this situation can give all of us ladies a lesson about not being complacent in a marriage, and understand that it will take efforts to foster a life long relationship.",

There are lots of reasons.\n\nBut more often than not, affairs are justified because they improve the life of the one partaking.

As a result it makes them a better spouse and allows them to be more present in their home life. \n\n\nAlso OP: If it makes you feel guilty, that\u2019s a totally valid way to feel!

When I went back on SA after we opened our marriage, I was a bit depressed because my husband had like 3-4 dates a week and I had maybe 1 m&g show up per week. Yeah, they're different kinds of dating, and I'm sure if I tried to vanilla date via tinder I'd have way more matches...but the fact of the matter is, there are some things sexually I can't provide for him and likewise, he cannot provide for me. He also has a way higher libido than I can keep up with, so a major benefit it is (spoilers): more sex.   \n\n\nHe and I both agree that sex with each other is special in ways different from other partners. I think he is actually starting to love one of his girlfriends and her feelings seem to be going the same way as well, so it's not just a purely physical relationship lacking. Different sexual *and* romantic relationships provide different things.   \n\n\nAnd no, my husband is 5'11 (or 6'0\" flat, maybe?) overweight, guy-at-the-Magic-The-Gathering-Tournament looking guy. But he has a great personality (and beard) so maybe women just sense his awesomeness through the Tinder app. Ymmv.",

When \\[Mrs. Coolidge\\] came to the chicken yard she noticed that a rooster was mating very frequently. She asked the attendant how often that happened and was told, \"Dozens of times each day.\" Mrs. Coolidge said, \"Tell that to the President when he comes by.\" Upon being told, the President asked, \"Same hen every time?\" The reply was, \"Oh, no, Mr. President, a different hen every time.\" President: \"Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge.\"",

It's usually just called dating. We date someone for a while and then breakup and start with someone else. Theoretically we should probably be doing this our entire lives.

Can you give me the lottery numbers for the next 10 years as well?   \n\n\nThe majority of men on this forum who brought up the idea of an open marriage with their spouse were shot down horribly and their wives made them feel like garbage for even asking.   \n\n\nCalling them cowards and assholes because they have needs that extend beyond food, sleep, and shelter is incorrect and far more asshole-ish behavior. Intimacy (not exclusively sex) is a human necessity so we all don't turn up like psychopaths. Refusing a necessity to your partner or refusing any sort of alternative is asshole behavior. Here's some examples of what caring about your partner looks like, along with one example of what not caring looks like:   \n\n\n* work to improve a need your partner feels is lacking \n* acknowledge your partner's issue and accept their proposed plan  \n\n* devise a solution where your partner gets more of what they feel is lacking, even if you don't put in more effort \n* ignore the partner's needs because the fact that they asked at all somehow hurts *your feelings* and the discussion turns into why *you* aren't good enough, instead of addressing the issue--he never brings it up again or if he does it's the same situation ad naseum until he figures out a way to get what he needs without purposefully hurting his partner  \n\n\nThe last is the most common, in my personal experience. I don't think anyone is a coward or a horrible person *solely* because they cheat. For all I know they have spoken to their wife about the idea of an open marriage and the wife responded in hysterics about the idea because the wife feels threatened, not good enough, depressed at her lack of libido, etc. Open relationships thrive on trust and communication more than monogamous relationships. If communication is close to perfect, open relationships are doomed to fail. I can understand why a partner with their own emotional baggage obfuscating communication would react that way. I can understand why the man would then cheat. It's far less painful than losing someone they love, but they have needs too. The wife is just as much in the wrong for not helping reach an agreement that benefits both parties and just putting her foot down and saying \"I don't care about *your* needs, I am not having sex with you and you are not having sex with anyone else.\" God, imagine if bills for the household were discussed the same way: Husband says wife isn't paying her share and they need a roof over their head, and she tells him because of her anxiety she can't work like she used to.  Husband gets an extra job without telling the wife, but tells her he gets a promotion at work so she isn't increasing her anxiety.  Is he a \"coward\" or \"asshole\" for lying to his wife about the extra income she refused to help with in the first place? I don't think so.",

When your lover just busted your balls over the toilet seat it is hard to feel attracted. And it works both ways of course. Boredom is self explanatory. Even the best sex gets old after a while . \n\nOpportunity is what is responsible for the spate of cheaters. It is incredibly easy to go on line and order up a delectable coed 30 years your junior as long as you have a few dollars to commit to the process. In the past years it was serendipity that enabled couples to match in the wild-usually at work or with social peers. Boredom and loss of intimacy have always been there.",

The best advise that I can offer is to know that most husbands continue to have a strong desire/need for sexual exploration/variety long after many wives have lost interest in that aspect of the marriage, or have become adsorbed with other aspects of life.   If you don't want a husband to go outside for sex, be sure to discuss his needs directly with him and offer him as much as you can in the way of \"variety and exploration\".

Honestly I was pressured into it by her, by her parents, by my parents, by my friends.  All of them said I would regret NOT getting married, and I was getting older.  All of them painted marriage as some kind of golden flower that would bloom more and more.  Pffft.\n\nI realized it was a mistake about 6 months into the marriage.  Now it's years deep and our net worth and overall lives are more intertwined  If we were to get divorced, we would both leave with more than we came in, but we are worse off apart, that's for sure, given the success of my wife's career which has been impressive.  It would pretty much destroy my social life.\n\nThe occasional SR gets my mind off of it all.\n\nWe have a borderline dead bedroom situation but it's probably my fault as much as hers.  There is some truth to the notion that when we are having sex, my motivation to seek out SRs is much less.  So one way to avoid a relationship where the guy cheats is to keep him satisfied and have good sexual chemistry.\n\nI will add - do not pressure a guy to marry you.  That will go a long way.\n\nI'm disturbed about the unprotected part.  I make a big point of sexual health because obviously I do not want to bring anything home.",

One had stay at home wife, one had career wife, etc. Sometimes, at the end of the day, it matters less what the wife does or who she is as a person. A man wants to cheat because he feels he can, or he likes the rush of manipulation/not getting caught, or he has money and wants a taste of spending it on girls, or he travels a lot and is lonely on the road, etc. You could be the wife fretting and spending your life making sure he doesn't cheat, but that just sounds like too much work. Over time they become 'don't ask don't tell' because money is the ultimate security, over a faithful spouse. \n\nI will say, in my experience, the cheating married SDs have the best mental gymnastics in justifying away their behavior while maintaining the perfect family man du jour image. \n\nTo keep faith while being an SB is hard. But it is true that some people never cheat.",

A lot of us do, and that can make things difficult when we are with people who really like sex. But don't get yourself worked up over it. The more you stress about it, the more you won't want to do it, or won't be able to enjoy it when you do.   \n\n\nI can't say whether your bf will leave you because you don't feel in the mood quite as often as he does. What I can say is that, you should talk to him about why you don't feel like it. Make sure he understands it has nothing to do with your attraction to him, how much you care about him, etc. It's just where you're at in life, and you want to make sure he understands he's loved even if you don't feel like you're keeping up with him sexually. Ask him how he feels about it, instead of assuming the worst that he's going to leave without ever trying to help you or your relationship navigate the obstacle. It's a really hard conversation to have, and I don't know if it will fix anything---but if you have anxiety about it, it's better than letting this feeling and thought fester and become a self fulfilling prophecy.",

I used to travel for work a lot, and in my mid-20s to early 30s a random hookup wasn't that difficult to accomplish and was a form of entertainment when I had nothing better to do in the evenings.\n\n>I guess I wonder if there is anything that can actually be done to entirely avoid cheating.\n\ndon't know about that.  I certainly don't have any insight, as I cheated on my first ever GF in 6th grade, and have failed monogamy ever since.\n\n>I notice now how he appeals to women who probably wouldn\u2019t have looked at him before\n\nI completely understand this. I was not the sought after guy in college, but when all my ladies' man friends went into entry level jobs and I went straight into management, fancy sports car, expense account, etc then girls from college starting coming up to me and saying \"wow, I probably should have said yes when you asked me out\". of course, my response was \"it's not too late to say yes now\".\n\n>I actually think he would be the type to cheat before admitting he wanted to be open.\n\nI think one of the things people struggle with is the thought that \"cheating on a relationship\" is always a \"threat to the relationship\".  None, zero, nada of the cheating I've done (will do) has ever been a threat to my primary relationship. even if a couple agree to have an open relationship, there is still the possibility your partner will decide they want to replace you with someone they were \"open\" with. just being \"open\" about seeing other people doesn't necessarily protect the relationship.\n\nthe really odd thing that I've discovered since my current SR got pretty serious and went to SBF/SGF status, is that I have been mostly monogamous with my SGF. I say mostly, because there has been other women, but only in threesomes with me and SGF (so she gets to enjoy too). and, one time, I let a stripper do a HJ on me (who ended up becoming one of our threesome girls, so maybe that doesn't count). it doesn't bother me that this has happened - I'm actually pretty happy about it. it just seems really out of character compared with my history.\n\nso, maybe there IS someone out there that would end up not cheating on you, even when there is easy opportunity and no reason not to.",

It could be sex, it could be an ear to listen, a smile they don't get back home, etc... Sugar babies allow men to be happier in their marriage and life.   It's similar to having a therapist.  Would you, future wife/ex sugar baby, begrudge your husband from going to his chiropractor, masseuse, therapist, even though it makes him happy?  Would he not let you go for mani/pedis, spas, shopping, even though it makes you happy?  You need to consider the net result, and not get hung up on how people attain happiness.",

Honesty is always best, no matter how uncomfortable or difficult it might be. Then they talk TOGETHER about a solution. I never said that he should just suffer. I never said they should get divorced. It's not one sided when I say that they both should be honest and communicate, while deciding together. Blaming a cheater for lying is NOT one sided, OMFG! \n\nSince apparently I have to disclose this to your misogynistic ass, if this situation was reverse where the female wasn't getting her needs met, and he felt guilty, etc. I would STILL be against her cheating, I would still think she was wrong for lying, and I would still say that they should be open, communicate, be honest, and come up with an option that they can both live with.

An open relationship or no relationship is always on the table (wait to see someone who would agree to open or just be single) and so there are three options.

If you didn't read a decent study (decent in this context means, unbiased researchers, proper sample size, recent within the last 5-10 years, and hopefully not the first of its kind) that directly supports the argument, and you weren't an evolutionary biology major, I'm not sure where you're getting the \"well it's just biology\". According to....whom? Your inner thoughts and whatever part of your ass you're pulling facts from? There are certain common sense things I think \"it's just biology\" applies to: colorblind genes being on the y chromosome therefore effect more men than women. But using \"it's just biology\"for the entire existence and reasoning of two genders when humans and the human psyche are extremely complex entities that *no one* fully understands is a bullshit argument. Especially when no one is ever able to submit a source on this opinion (likely because it's a regurgitated fallacy.)\n\n Second of all, blaming biology for shitty behavior is childish at best.

So, for example, human history seems to suggest that monogamous pair-bonding is the expected behavior of humans for the last 10,000 years or so and  it may be useful to understand why. Conversely, history, psychology, and other scientific fields seem to show that humans are TERRIBLE at lifelong monogamy. Again, I think it's interesting to pursue the \"why\" of that. \n\nBut the study of human behavior and its \"whys\" is entirely different from ethics or morality. Those go more under the realm of philosophy or religion. I have an interest in both things. The last four years of my marriage, my wife didn't touch me, much less have sex with me. To this day I think religion fucked us both up in regards to sexuality. I ultimately took the only path I could, divorce, but that path was hard as hell and and created a huge amount of trauma for my kids and extended family that lasted more than 5 years. Now I don't regret getting divorced, but my experience has caused me to have a lot of compassion for men and women in sexless marriages. Our , yes, \"biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to depression and other forms of mental illness. \n\nTo circle back around to where I started, what I want to see is for the whole structure of marriage and the stupid, unrealistic expectation of lifelong monogamy to fucking go away. It doesn't work for the majority of humans. So if \"cheating \" is the least worst option for a person, I support them. I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.",

Biology describes tendencies, it is not a law. I would assume that ethics and morality play bigger parts in cheating and non-monogamy than biology, but since there's 0 research to attest to that, I won't make statements like \"cheating is a moral issue, not biology\"--because it's factually impossible to prove. The same way \"it's just biology\" is factually impossible to prove, and is therefore an incorrect and bullshit statement. I hope this better explains my stance on that statement.   \n\n\n>biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection  is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to  depression and other forms of mental illness.    \n\n\nI very much agree, so it confuses me to read other posters calling an entire gender babies or trash because they have human needs that refuse to be met by partners that supposedly care about them. Open relationships and polyamory aren't for everyone, and I would argue (as a person in an open marriage) that polyamory is not a life-long lifestyle for many people. So unfortunately, just \"leave them or have an open marriage but don't cheat\" is not valid advice.   \n\n\n> I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.    \n\n\nI am always surprised when people my age (mid twenties) get surprised/offended by our decision to be in an open relationship. Even more surprised when women who are entering a relationship with a self-identified married man (my husband) have opinions about the kind of person *I* am for being in an open marriage. Not him, the person they are sleeping with...but the other woman in the relationship.   \n\n\nWhile society has an impact on the views of polyamory and other forms of non-monogamy, I feel as though the onus is on the individuals to stay sane in a relationship. Sane people make better choices for what works best for them, their life, their partner, and their relationship. Non-monogamy as a concept is not a silver bullet, it depends on the individuals entering the relationship to be very clear and supportive with their partners.",

I agree with just about everything you say, including the idea that open relationships and polyamory are not silver bullets, but I do think the social and societal change that marriage and lifelong monogamy to one partner is no longer the only expectation or norm is moving in the right direction. One of many positive changes regarding sexuality to come about in the last few decades.",

I would just like to point out that a lot more animals are promiscuous than are  monogamous, And that only one species of primate, which is what humans are, is monogamous. All the others, chimps, bonobos, gorillas etc. are promiscuous. Promiscuous, in this context is a scientific term describing animal sexual behavior, not a judgemental thing. I believe and I think the science bears out, that humans did not evolve with a sexuality involving monogamous pairing. There\u2019s a great book on this called Sex at Dawn, by Cacilda Jeth\u00e1 and Christopher Ryan. To enter into a long term relationship or a marriage vowing lifelong monogamy is foolish. I did something even more foolish, I made that vow on my wedding day and had never had sex with my wife. \u201cSaving yourself for marriage\u201d is literally one of the dumbest things that people can do and I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s restricted almost entirely to religious people.",

Do you think there may be instances where infidelity is the least-worst option?

Do you think divorce in that situation is more \"moral\" than infidelity? )\n\nI am divorced / single and don't have any skin in this game so I really am asking philosophically.",

If you want an open marriage ,  say it in the marriage vows at the ceremony.  I think most people don't do that because they know deep inside it's a joke.    I  believe polyamorous relationships fail at a greater rate than other relationships,  because anything based on sexual variety and pleasure is already on weak ground.   \n\nYour chronic disease scenario is a rare unusual case, and not the norm.  The question here is it ok to lie and deceive the most important person in your life because of some perceived benefit, mostly selfish?  No I don't think so.   Many adults of all ages have not had sex for years.   You won't die from it.   If the hand you're dealt is no more sex,  then no more sex.   Take care of your wife and grow from it.  If you can't handle it, pleasure yourself and use porn.  Because frankly,  f'ing around while your wife is slowly dying is pretty crappy.",

I think most people don't do that because they know deep inside it's a joke.\u201d \n\nThis begs a few questions.  First, are the vows at the ceremony the only ones that matter? The way you phrase it seems to imply that a couple can\u2019t change their agreement after they\u2019ve been married. For example they can\u2019t decide to open their marriage 10 years later. I\u2019m assuming that is not what you\u2019re saying because its a really really dumb idea. I also don\u2019t know what you mean when you say \u201cthey don\u2019t say that at the ceremony because they know deep down inside it\u2019s a joke\u201d. Do you know what\u2019s a joke? 20-somethings making a promise of lifelong monogamy. \n\nI endured four years of literally not beng touched by my wife. And because I didn\u2019t cheat during that time period, but looked at a lot of  porn and whacked off a lot, I feel like an expert on that subject. I know that having no physical touch or sex for years can literally drive you to depression, suicide and near insanity. So when I say something like you have to do whatever you have to do to stay sane and stay married I know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re pretty damn young, probably in your 20s. Because when I was in my 20s I was self-righteous as hell and religious. And I thought I was right about everything. The growth I have experience now that I am in my 50s is all centered around understanding that the world is complex and nuanced. Hopefully you will understand that one day too.",

That's on you.  Even the Catholic Church as rigid as they are,  would have allowed you to annul your marriage, if your wife was withholding sex.\n\nAnd don't apply your situation as a benchmark for all of history.   Yes, the current state of affairs is sad,  but it wasn't always that way.  Many people (many of our parents and grandparents) , mostly 20 somethings and younger, in the US and other countries in prior decades had successful monogamous marriages.\n\nAnd yes, open marriages are a farce.   When you start saying sex with other people is the key to being happy,  you're doomed,  because love is sacrifice and commitment  and no part of that equation shows that.  It's placing so large a value on something that loses it's appeal as we age.\n\nI'm sorry you suffered, but in the end,  do you believe in integrity.

That one change is probably the most important development in the history of our species. Before then, there was no \"property\", just clans hunting and gathering to survive. There is a lot of evidence that before that event, humans did not pair bond, but rather behaved more like bonobos, with female-directed promiscuity being the norm. There is a lot of evidence for this, including the size and shape of the human penis, studies of modern isolated hunter-gatherer. But once we stopped wandering and started claiming property, it became necessary to be able to know paternity of children, which is how marriage and the concept of ownership of women came about. The truth is, for most of the history of marriage, it was a property contract and the beginning of \"the patriarchy\". Monogamy and marriage fit together like hand and glove.

There are lots of reasons.\n\nBut more often than not, affairs are justified because they improve the life of the one partaking. Makes them happier, makes them feel desired or fulfilled, whatever have you. As a result it makes them a better spouse and allows them to be more present in their home life. \n\n\nAlso OP: If it makes you feel guilty, that\u2019s a totally valid way to feel! Even if you really like your SD, if his presence in your life causes you mental unease it\u2019s in your best interest to move on and find a healthier dynamic that works for you :)",

Turns out I was intensely turned on by something I would never encounter outside the specialized porn industry.   When we added this to our bedroom...I went insane.   I needed sex with her constantly...a brand new honeymoon period.   But, after several years of the best sex of my life, she  grew disinterested.  Her chase for my affection was over....she won.\n\nI always tell people...I wish she had just cheated.  Our marriage may have survived...maybe turned 'Open'.

These fantasies or whatever were taking away so much attention from my relationship with my wife because I was more focused on what I\u2019d missed out on than what I had in front of me. Now, I no longer wonder. I still sugar a bit, but more because I enjoy helping people who need $ and just to meet new people than for the sex (though that\u2019s still fun).

When I went back on SA after we opened our marriage, I was a bit depressed because my husband had like 3-4 dates a week and I had maybe 1 m&g show up per week. Yeah, they're different kinds of dating, and I'm sure if I tried to vanilla date via tinder I'd have way more matches...but the fact of the matter is, there are some things sexually I can't provide for him and likewise, he cannot provide for me. He also has a way higher libido than I can keep up with, so a major benefit it is (spoilers): more sex.   \n\n\nHe and I both agree that sex with each other is special in ways different from other partners. I think he is actually starting to love one of his girlfriends and her feelings seem to be going the same way as well, so it's not just a purely physical relationship lacking. Different sexual *and* romantic relationships provide different things.   \n\n\nAnd no, my husband is 5'11 (or 6'0\" flat, maybe?) overweight, guy-at-the-Magic-The-Gathering-Tournament looking guy. But he has a great personality (and beard) so maybe women just sense his awesomeness through the Tinder app. Ymmv.",

Can you give me the lottery numbers for the next 10 years as well?   \n\n\nThe majority of men on this forum who brought up the idea of an open marriage with their spouse were shot down horribly and their wives made them feel like garbage for even asking.   \n\n\nCalling them cowards and assholes because they have needs that extend beyond food, sleep, and shelter is incorrect and far more asshole-ish behavior. Intimacy (not exclusively sex) is a human necessity so we all don't turn up like psychopaths. Refusing a necessity to your partner or refusing any sort of alternative is asshole behavior. Here's some examples of what caring about your partner looks like, along with one example of what not caring looks like:   \n\n\n* work to improve a need your partner feels is lacking \n* acknowledge your partner's issue and accept their proposed plan  \n\n* devise a solution where your partner gets more of what they feel is lacking, even if you don't put in more effort \n* ignore the partner's needs because the fact that they asked at all somehow hurts *your feelings* and the discussion turns into why *you* aren't good enough, instead of addressing the issue--he never brings it up again or if he does it's the same situation ad naseum until he figures out a way to get what he needs without purposefully hurting his partner  \n\n\nThe last is the most common, in my personal experience. I don't think anyone is a coward or a horrible person *solely* because they cheat. For all I know they have spoken to their wife about the idea of an open marriage and the wife responded in hysterics about the idea because the wife feels threatened, not good enough, depressed at her lack of libido, etc. Open relationships thrive on trust and communication more than monogamous relationships. If communication is close to perfect, open relationships are doomed to fail. I can understand why a partner with their own emotional baggage obfuscating communication would react that way. I can understand why the man would then cheat. It's far less painful than losing someone they love, but they have needs too. The wife is just as much in the wrong for not helping reach an agreement that benefits both parties and just putting her foot down and saying \"I don't care about *your* needs, I am not having sex with you and you are not having sex with anyone else.\" God, imagine if bills for the household were discussed the same way: Husband says wife isn't paying her share and they need a roof over their head, and she tells him because of her anxiety she can't work like she used to.  Husband gets an extra job without telling the wife, but tells her he gets a promotion at work so she isn't increasing her anxiety.  Is he a \"coward\" or \"asshole\" for lying to his wife about the extra income she refused to help with in the first place? I don't think so.",

I used to be a sex once-a-day-minimum girl, never had kids, in great shape. Then had a few health crises back-to-back and lost my libido. Medications, sex therapy, regular therapy, thousands in tests, just for MULTIPLE doctors to shrug their shoulders and say \"I'm not sure--have you tried not watching porn or using a vibrator?\" r/thanksimcured   \n\n\nIt can't always be fixed. And it can't always be \"worked on\" because some people are monogamous, and some people \\*aren't\\*, and sometimes, it takes a while for both parties to understand the type of people they are. By then the relationship sucks, but they still love their partner and don't want to or can't leave them.   \n\n\nThere used to a be a poster whose wife had serious medical issues---like, she was on a ventilator 3 days out of the week or something like that. Obviously, sex was out of the question. Obviously, he still loved her if he drove her to the hospital and stayed with her the entire time she was getting treatment. Obviously, the guy still has needs. Is he a terrible person or a coward for cheating when her health was deteriorating and he didn't want to stress the relationship by asking his dying wife what should thought of an open marriage? Nah. It couldn't be fixed, it couldn't be helped, and situations similar to this happen all the time. Posters who think cheating is 100% always avoidable and the people that do it are Hitler reincarnated have serious issues with themselves they need to work out. The world is not so black and white.",

One had stay at home wife, one had career wife, etc. Sometimes, at the end of the day, it matters less what the wife does or who she is as a person. A man wants to cheat because he feels he can, or he likes the rush of manipulation/not getting caught, or he has money and wants a taste of spending it on girls, or he travels a lot and is lonely on the road, etc. You could be the wife fretting and spending your life making sure he doesn't cheat, but that just sounds like too much work. Over time they become 'don't ask don't tell' because money is the ultimate security, over a faithful spouse. \n\nI will say, in my experience, the cheating married SDs have the best mental gymnastics in justifying away their behavior while maintaining the perfect family man du jour image. \n\nTo keep faith while being an SB is hard. But it is true that some people never cheat.",

A lot of us do, and that can make things difficult when we are with people who really like sex. But don't get yourself worked up over it. The more you stress about it, the more you won't want to do it, or won't be able to enjoy it when you do.   \n\n\nI can't say whether your bf will leave you because you don't feel in the mood quite as often as he does. What I can say is that, you should talk to him about why you don't feel like it. Make sure he understands it has nothing to do with your attraction to him, how much you care about him, etc. It's just where you're at in life, and you want to make sure he understands he's loved even if you don't feel like you're keeping up with him sexually. Ask him how he feels about it, instead of assuming the worst that he's going to leave without ever trying to help you or your relationship navigate the obstacle. It's a really hard conversation to have, and I don't know if it will fix anything---but if you have anxiety about it, it's better than letting this feeling and thought fester and become a self fulfilling prophecy.",

I used to travel for work a lot, and in my mid-20s to early 30s a random hookup wasn't that difficult to accomplish and was a form of entertainment when I had nothing better to do in the evenings.\n\n>I guess I wonder if there is anything that can actually be done to entirely avoid cheating.\n\ndon't know about that.  I certainly don't have any insight, as I cheated on my first ever GF in 6th grade, and have failed monogamy ever since.\n\n>I notice now how he appeals to women who probably wouldn\u2019t have looked at him before\n\nI completely understand this. I was not the sought after guy in college, but when all my ladies' man friends went into entry level jobs and I went straight into management, fancy sports car, expense account, etc then girls from college starting coming up to me and saying \"wow, I probably should have said yes when you asked me out\". of course, my response was \"it's not too late to say yes now\".\n\n>I actually think he would be the type to cheat before admitting he wanted to be open.\n\nI think one of the things people struggle with is the thought that \"cheating on a relationship\" is always a \"threat to the relationship\".  None, zero, nada of the cheating I've done (will do) has ever been a threat to my primary relationship. even if a couple agree to have an open relationship, there is still the possibility your partner will decide they want to replace you with someone they were \"open\" with. just being \"open\" about seeing other people doesn't necessarily protect the relationship.\n\nthe really odd thing that I've discovered since my current SR got pretty serious and went to SBF/SGF status, is that I have been mostly monogamous with my SGF. I say mostly, because there has been other women, but only in threesomes with me and SGF (so she gets to enjoy too). and, one time, I let a stripper do a HJ on me (who ended up becoming one of our threesome girls, so maybe that doesn't count). it doesn't bother me that this has happened - I'm actually pretty happy about it. it just seems really out of character compared with my history.\n\nso, maybe there IS someone out there that would end up not cheating on you, even when there is easy opportunity and no reason not to.",

If you didn't read a decent study (decent in this context means, unbiased researchers, proper sample size, recent within the last 5-10 years, and hopefully not the first of its kind) that directly supports the argument, and you weren't an evolutionary biology major, I'm not sure where you're getting the \"well it's just biology\". According to....whom? Your inner thoughts and whatever part of your ass you're pulling facts from? There are certain common sense things I think \"it's just biology\" applies to: colorblind genes being on the y chromosome therefore effect more men than women. But using \"it's just biology\"for the entire existence and reasoning of two genders when humans and the human psyche are extremely complex entities that *no one* fully understands is a bullshit argument. Especially when no one is ever able to submit a source on this opinion (likely because it's a regurgitated fallacy.)\n\n Second of all, blaming biology for shitty behavior is childish at best.

So, for example, human history seems to suggest that monogamous pair-bonding is the expected behavior of humans for the last 10,000 years or so and  it may be useful to understand why. Conversely, history, psychology, and other scientific fields seem to show that humans are TERRIBLE at lifelong monogamy. Again, I think it's interesting to pursue the \"why\" of that. \n\nBut the study of human behavior and its \"whys\" is entirely different from ethics or morality. Those go more under the realm of philosophy or religion. I have an interest in both things. The last four years of my marriage, my wife didn't touch me, much less have sex with me. To this day I think religion fucked us both up in regards to sexuality. I ultimately took the only path I could, divorce, but that path was hard as hell and and created a huge amount of trauma for my kids and extended family that lasted more than 5 years. Now I don't regret getting divorced, but my experience has caused me to have a lot of compassion for men and women in sexless marriages. Our , yes, \"biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to depression and other forms of mental illness. \n\nTo circle back around to where I started, what I want to see is for the whole structure of marriage and the stupid, unrealistic expectation of lifelong monogamy to fucking go away. It doesn't work for the majority of humans. So if \"cheating \" is the least worst option for a person, I support them. I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.",

Biology describes tendencies, it is not a law. I would assume that ethics and morality play bigger parts in cheating and non-monogamy than biology, but since there's 0 research to attest to that, I won't make statements like \"cheating is a moral issue, not biology\"--because it's factually impossible to prove. The same way \"it's just biology\" is factually impossible to prove, and is therefore an incorrect and bullshit statement. I hope this better explains my stance on that statement.   \n\n\n>biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection  is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to  depression and other forms of mental illness.    \n\n\nI very much agree, so it confuses me to read other posters calling an entire gender babies or trash because they have human needs that refuse to be met by partners that supposedly care about them. Open relationships and polyamory aren't for everyone, and I would argue (as a person in an open marriage) that polyamory is not a life-long lifestyle for many people. So unfortunately, just \"leave them or have an open marriage but don't cheat\" is not valid advice.   \n\n\n> I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.    \n\n\nI am always surprised when people my age (mid twenties) get surprised/offended by our decision to be in an open relationship. Even more surprised when women who are entering a relationship with a self-identified married man (my husband) have opinions about the kind of person *I* am for being in an open marriage. Not him, the person they are sleeping with...but the other woman in the relationship.   \n\n\nWhile society has an impact on the views of polyamory and other forms of non-monogamy, I feel as though the onus is on the individuals to stay sane in a relationship. Sane people make better choices for what works best for them, their life, their partner, and their relationship. Non-monogamy as a concept is not a silver bullet, it depends on the individuals entering the relationship to be very clear and supportive with their partners.",

I would just like to point out that a lot more animals are promiscuous than are  monogamous, And that only one species of primate, which is what humans are, is monogamous. All the others, chimps, bonobos, gorillas etc. are promiscuous. Promiscuous, in this context is a scientific term describing animal sexual behavior, not a judgemental thing. I believe and I think the science bears out, that humans did not evolve with a sexuality involving monogamous pairing. There\u2019s a great book on this called Sex at Dawn, by Cacilda Jeth\u00e1 and Christopher Ryan. To enter into a long term relationship or a marriage vowing lifelong monogamy is foolish. I did something even more foolish, I made that vow on my wedding day and had never had sex with my wife. \u201cSaving yourself for marriage\u201d is literally one of the dumbest things that people can do and I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s restricted almost entirely to religious people.",

Do you think lifelong monogamy with one partner is the only acceptable option for people? Or are you comfortable with serial monogamy?\n2. How do you feel about polyamory and open relationships?\n3. Do you think there may be instances where infidelity is the least-worst option?

Do you think divorce in that situation is more \"moral\" than infidelity? )\n\nI am divorced / single and don't have any skin in this game so I really am asking philosophically.",

I  believe polyamorous relationships fail at a greater rate than other relationships,  because anything based on sexual variety and pleasure is already on weak ground.   \n\nYour chronic disease scenario is a rare unusual case, and not the norm.  The question here is it ok to lie and deceive the most important person in your life because of some perceived benefit, mostly selfish?  No I don't think so.   Many adults of all ages have not had sex for years.   You won't die from it.   If the hand you're dealt is no more sex,  then no more sex.   Take care of your wife and grow from it.  If you can't handle it, pleasure yourself and use porn.  Because frankly,  f'ing around while your wife is slowly dying is pretty crappy.",

I think most people don't do that because they know deep inside it's a joke.\u201d \n\nThis begs a few questions.  First, are the vows at the ceremony the only ones that matter? The way you phrase it seems to imply that a couple can\u2019t change their agreement after they\u2019ve been married. For example they can\u2019t decide to open their marriage 10 years later. I\u2019m assuming that is not what you\u2019re saying because its a really really dumb idea. I also don\u2019t know what you mean when you say \u201cthey don\u2019t say that at the ceremony because they know deep down inside it\u2019s a joke\u201d. Do you know what\u2019s a joke? 20-somethings making a promise of lifelong monogamy. \n\nI endured four years of literally not beng touched by my wife. And because I didn\u2019t cheat during that time period, but looked at a lot of  porn and whacked off a lot, I feel like an expert on that subject. I know that having no physical touch or sex for years can literally drive you to depression, suicide and near insanity. So when I say something like you have to do whatever you have to do to stay sane and stay married I know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re pretty damn young, probably in your 20s. Because when I was in my 20s I was self-righteous as hell and religious. And I thought I was right about everything. The growth I have experience now that I am in my 50s is all centered around understanding that the world is complex and nuanced. Hopefully you will understand that one day too.",

Yes, the current state of affairs is sad,  but it wasn't always that way.  Many people (many of our parents and grandparents) , mostly 20 somethings and younger, in the US and other countries in prior decades had successful monogamous marriages.\n\nAnd yes, open marriages are a farce.

That one change is probably the most important development in the history of our species. Before then, there was no \"property\", just clans hunting and gathering to survive. There is a lot of evidence that before that event, humans did not pair bond, but rather behaved more like bonobos, with female-directed promiscuity being the norm. There is a lot of evidence for this, including the size and shape of the human penis, studies of modern isolated hunter-gatherer. But once we stopped wandering and started claiming property, it became necessary to be able to know paternity of children, which is how marriage and the concept of ownership of women came about. The truth is, for most of the history of marriage, it was a property contract and the beginning of \"the patriarchy\". Monogamy and marriage fit together like hand and glove. I always find it interesting when women defend marriage. If only they understood the history of the institution.",

What bothers me about that though is what your showing children a marriage looks like. My parents fought constantly, showed no affection towards each other ( that o could see) and didn\u2019t even sleep in the same bed together (I had asked why and snoring was said to be the reason). Thankfully I had my friends parents to show me that married people actually love each other to show me a different example of a loving marital unit. But then again divorce is not always the better option as I\u2019ve seen kids worlds torn apart by it. I\u2019ve come to the conclusion one way or the other it\u2019s just hard. Especially when kids are involved. Another reason why I believe SBs play am important role in these cases.",

When I went back on SA after we opened our marriage, I was a bit depressed because my husband had like 3-4 dates a week and I had maybe 1 m&g show up per week. Yeah, they're different kinds of dating, and I'm sure if I tried to vanilla date via tinder I'd have way more matches...but the fact of the matter is, there are some things sexually I can't provide for him and likewise, he cannot provide for me. He also has a way higher libido than I can keep up with, so a major benefit it is (spoilers): more sex.   \n\n\nHe and I both agree that sex with each other is special in ways different from other partners. I think he is actually starting to love one of his girlfriends and her feelings seem to be going the same way as well, so it's not just a purely physical relationship lacking. Different sexual *and* romantic relationships provide different things.   \n\n\nAnd no, my husband is 5'11 (or 6'0\" flat, maybe?) overweight, guy-at-the-Magic-The-Gathering-Tournament looking guy. But he has a great personality (and beard) so maybe women just sense his awesomeness through the Tinder app. Ymmv.",

Can you give me the lottery numbers for the next 10 years as well?   \n\n\nThe majority of men on this forum who brought up the idea of an open marriage with their spouse were shot down horribly and their wives made them feel like garbage for even asking.   \n\n\nCalling them cowards and assholes because they have needs that extend beyond food, sleep, and shelter is incorrect and far more asshole-ish behavior. Intimacy (not exclusively sex) is a human necessity so we all don't turn up like psychopaths. Refusing a necessity to your partner or refusing any sort of alternative is asshole behavior. Here's some examples of what caring about your partner looks like, along with one example of what not caring looks like:   \n\n\n* work to improve a need your partner feels is lacking \n* acknowledge your partner's issue and accept their proposed plan  \n\n* devise a solution where your partner gets more of what they feel is lacking, even if you don't put in more effort \n* ignore the partner's needs because the fact that they asked at all somehow hurts *your feelings* and the discussion turns into why *you* aren't good enough, instead of addressing the issue--he never brings it up again or if he does it's the same situation ad naseum until he figures out a way to get what he needs without purposefully hurting his partner  \n\n\nThe last is the most common, in my personal experience. I don't think anyone is a coward or a horrible person *solely* because they cheat. For all I know they have spoken to their wife about the idea of an open marriage and the wife responded in hysterics about the idea because the wife feels threatened, not good enough, depressed at her lack of libido, etc. Open relationships thrive on trust and communication more than monogamous relationships. If communication is close to perfect, open relationships are doomed to fail. I can understand why a partner with their own emotional baggage obfuscating communication would react that way. I can understand why the man would then cheat. It's far less painful than losing someone they love, but they have needs too. The wife is just as much in the wrong for not helping reach an agreement that benefits both parties and just putting her foot down and saying \"I don't care about *your* needs, I am not having sex with you and you are not having sex with anyone else.\" God, imagine if bills for the household were discussed the same way: Husband says wife isn't paying her share and they need a roof over their head, and she tells him because of her anxiety she can't work like she used to.  Husband gets an extra job without telling the wife, but tells her he gets a promotion at work so she isn't increasing her anxiety.  Is he a \"coward\" or \"asshole\" for lying to his wife about the extra income she refused to help with in the first place? I don't think so.",

One had stay at home wife, one had career wife, etc. Sometimes, at the end of the day, it matters less what the wife does or who she is as a person. A man wants to cheat because he feels he can, or he likes the rush of manipulation/not getting caught, or he has money and wants a taste of spending it on girls, or he travels a lot and is lonely on the road, etc. You could be the wife fretting and spending your life making sure he doesn't cheat, but that just sounds like too much work. Over time they become 'don't ask don't tell' because money is the ultimate security, over a faithful spouse. \n\nI will say, in my experience, the cheating married SDs have the best mental gymnastics in justifying away their behavior while maintaining the perfect family man du jour image. \n\nTo keep faith while being an SB is hard. But it is true that some people never cheat.",

A lot of us do, and that can make things difficult when we are with people who really like sex. But don't get yourself worked up over it. The more you stress about it, the more you won't want to do it, or won't be able to enjoy it when you do.   \n\n\nI can't say whether your bf will leave you because you don't feel in the mood quite as often as he does. What I can say is that, you should talk to him about why you don't feel like it. Make sure he understands it has nothing to do with your attraction to him, how much you care about him, etc. It's just where you're at in life, and you want to make sure he understands he's loved even if you don't feel like you're keeping up with him sexually. Ask him how he feels about it, instead of assuming the worst that he's going to leave without ever trying to help you or your relationship navigate the obstacle. It's a really hard conversation to have, and I don't know if it will fix anything---but if you have anxiety about it, it's better than letting this feeling and thought fester and become a self fulfilling prophecy.",

I used to travel for work a lot, and in my mid-20s to early 30s a random hookup wasn't that difficult to accomplish and was a form of entertainment when I had nothing better to do in the evenings.\n\n>I guess I wonder if there is anything that can actually be done to entirely avoid cheating.\n\ndon't know about that.  I certainly don't have any insight, as I cheated on my first ever GF in 6th grade, and have failed monogamy ever since.\n\n>I notice now how he appeals to women who probably wouldn\u2019t have looked at him before\n\nI completely understand this. I was not the sought after guy in college, but when all my ladies' man friends went into entry level jobs and I went straight into management, fancy sports car, expense account, etc then girls from college starting coming up to me and saying \"wow, I probably should have said yes when you asked me out\". of course, my response was \"it's not too late to say yes now\".\n\n>I actually think he would be the type to cheat before admitting he wanted to be open.\n\nI think one of the things people struggle with is the thought that \"cheating on a relationship\" is always a \"threat to the relationship\".  None, zero, nada of the cheating I've done (will do) has ever been a threat to my primary relationship. even if a couple agree to have an open relationship, there is still the possibility your partner will decide they want to replace you with someone they were \"open\" with. just being \"open\" about seeing other people doesn't necessarily protect the relationship.\n\nthe really odd thing that I've discovered since my current SR got pretty serious and went to SBF/SGF status, is that I have been mostly monogamous with my SGF. I say mostly, because there has been other women, but only in threesomes with me and SGF (so she gets to enjoy too). and, one time, I let a stripper do a HJ on me (who ended up becoming one of our threesome girls, so maybe that doesn't count). it doesn't bother me that this has happened - I'm actually pretty happy about it. it just seems really out of character compared with my history.\n\nso, maybe there IS someone out there that would end up not cheating on you, even when there is easy opportunity and no reason not to.",

According to....whom? Your inner thoughts and whatever part of your ass you're pulling facts from? There are certain common sense things I think \"it's just biology\" applies to: colorblind genes being on the y chromosome therefore effect more men than women. But using \"it's just biology\"for the entire existence and reasoning of two genders when humans and the human psyche are extremely complex entities that *no one* fully understands is a bullshit argument.

So, for example, human history seems to suggest that monogamous pair-bonding is the expected behavior of humans for the last 10,000 years or so and  it may be useful to understand why. Conversely, history, psychology, and other scientific fields seem to show that humans are TERRIBLE at lifelong monogamy. Again, I think it's interesting to pursue the \"why\" of that. \n\nBut the study of human behavior and its \"whys\" is entirely different from ethics or morality. Those go more under the realm of philosophy or religion. I have an interest in both things. The last four years of my marriage, my wife didn't touch me, much less have sex with me. To this day I think religion fucked us both up in regards to sexuality. I ultimately took the only path I could, divorce, but that path was hard as hell and and created a huge amount of trauma for my kids and extended family that lasted more than 5 years. Now I don't regret getting divorced, but my experience has caused me to have a lot of compassion for men and women in sexless marriages. Our , yes, \"biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to depression and other forms of mental illness. \n\nTo circle back around to where I started, what I want to see is for the whole structure of marriage and the stupid, unrealistic expectation of lifelong monogamy to fucking go away. It doesn't work for the majority of humans. So if \"cheating \" is the least worst option for a person, I support them. I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.",

Biology describes tendencies, it is not a law. I would assume that ethics and morality play bigger parts in cheating and non-monogamy than biology, but since there's 0 research to attest to that, I won't make statements like \"cheating is a moral issue, not biology\"--because it's factually impossible to prove. The same way \"it's just biology\" is factually impossible to prove, and is therefore an incorrect and bullshit statement. I hope this better explains my stance on that statement.   \n\n\n>biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection  is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to  depression and other forms of mental illness.    \n\n\nI very much agree, so it confuses me to read other posters calling an entire gender babies or trash because they have human needs that refuse to be met by partners that supposedly care about them. Open relationships and polyamory aren't for everyone, and I would argue (as a person in an open marriage) that polyamory is not a life-long lifestyle for many people. So unfortunately, just \"leave them or have an open marriage but don't cheat\" is not valid advice.   \n\n\n> I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.    \n\n\nI am always surprised when people my age (mid twenties) get surprised/offended by our decision to be in an open relationship. Even more surprised when women who are entering a relationship with a self-identified married man (my husband) have opinions about the kind of person *I* am for being in an open marriage. Not him, the person they are sleeping with...but the other woman in the relationship.   \n\n\nWhile society has an impact on the views of polyamory and other forms of non-monogamy, I feel as though the onus is on the individuals to stay sane in a relationship. Sane people make better choices for what works best for them, their life, their partner, and their relationship. Non-monogamy as a concept is not a silver bullet, it depends on the individuals entering the relationship to be very clear and supportive with their partners.",

I think most people don't do that because they know deep inside it's a joke.\u201d \n\nThis begs a few questions.  First, are the vows at the ceremony the only ones that matter? The way you phrase it seems to imply that a couple can\u2019t change their agreement after they\u2019ve been married. For example they can\u2019t decide to open their marriage 10 years later. I\u2019m assuming that is not what you\u2019re saying because its a really really dumb idea. I also don\u2019t know what you mean when you say \u201cthey don\u2019t say that at the ceremony because they know deep down inside it\u2019s a joke\u201d. Do you know what\u2019s a joke? 20-somethings making a promise of lifelong monogamy. \n\nI endured four years of literally not beng touched by my wife. And because I didn\u2019t cheat during that time period, but looked at a lot of  porn and whacked off a lot, I feel like an expert on that subject. I know that having no physical touch or sex for years can literally drive you to depression, suicide and near insanity. So when I say something like you have to do whatever you have to do to stay sane and stay married I know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re pretty damn young, probably in your 20s. Because when I was in my 20s I was self-righteous as hell and religious. And I thought I was right about everything. The growth I have experience now that I am in my 50s is all centered around understanding that the world is complex and nuanced. Hopefully you will understand that one day too.",

That's on you.  Even the Catholic Church as rigid as they are,  would have allowed you to annul your marriage, if your wife was withholding sex.\n\nAnd don't apply your situation as a benchmark for all of history.   Yes, the current state of affairs is sad,  but it wasn't always that way.  Many people (many of our parents and grandparents) , mostly 20 somethings and younger, in the US and other countries in prior decades had successful monogamous marriages.\n\nAnd yes, open marriages are a farce.   When you start saying sex with other people is the key to being happy,  you're doomed,  because love is sacrifice and commitment  and no part of that equation shows that.  It's placing so large a value on something that loses it's appeal as we age.\n\nI'm sorry you suffered, but in the end,  do you believe in integrity.

That one change is probably the most important development in the history of our species. Before then, there was no \"property\", just clans hunting and gathering to survive. There is a lot of evidence that before that event, humans did not pair bond, but rather behaved more like bonobos, with female-directed promiscuity being the norm. There is a lot of evidence for this, including the size and shape of the human penis, studies of modern isolated hunter-gatherer. But once we stopped wandering and started claiming property, it became necessary to be able to know paternity of children, which is how marriage and the concept of ownership of women came about. The truth is, for most of the history of marriage, it was a property contract and the beginning of \"the patriarchy\". Monogamy and marriage fit together like hand and glove.

Can you give me the lottery numbers for the next 10 years as well?   \n\n\nThe majority of men on this forum who brought up the idea of an open marriage with their spouse were shot down horribly and their wives made them feel like garbage for even asking.   \n\n\nCalling them cowards and assholes because they have needs that extend beyond food, sleep, and shelter is incorrect and far more asshole-ish behavior. Intimacy (not exclusively sex) is a human necessity so we all don't turn up like psychopaths. Refusing a necessity to your partner or refusing any sort of alternative is asshole behavior. Here's some examples of what caring about your partner looks like, along with one example of what not caring looks like:   \n\n\n* work to improve a need your partner feels is lacking \n* acknowledge your partner's issue and accept their proposed plan  \n\n* devise a solution where your partner gets more of what they feel is lacking, even if you don't put in more effort \n* ignore the partner's needs because the fact that they asked at all somehow hurts *your feelings* and the discussion turns into why *you* aren't good enough, instead of addressing the issue--he never brings it up again or if he does it's the same situation ad naseum until he figures out a way to get what he needs without purposefully hurting his partner  \n\n\nThe last is the most common, in my personal experience. I don't think anyone is a coward or a horrible person *solely* because they cheat. For all I know they have spoken to their wife about the idea of an open marriage and the wife responded in hysterics about the idea because the wife feels threatened, not good enough, depressed at her lack of libido, etc. Open relationships thrive on trust and communication more than monogamous relationships. If communication is close to perfect, open relationships are doomed to fail. I can understand why a partner with their own emotional baggage obfuscating communication would react that way. I can understand why the man would then cheat. It's far less painful than losing someone they love, but they have needs too. The wife is just as much in the wrong for not helping reach an agreement that benefits both parties and just putting her foot down and saying \"I don't care about *your* needs, I am not having sex with you and you are not having sex with anyone else.\" God, imagine if bills for the household were discussed the same way: Husband says wife isn't paying her share and they need a roof over their head, and she tells him because of her anxiety she can't work like she used to.  Husband gets an extra job without telling the wife, but tells her he gets a promotion at work so she isn't increasing her anxiety.  Is he a \"coward\" or \"asshole\" for lying to his wife about the extra income she refused to help with in the first place? I don't think so.",

An open relationship or no relationship is always on the table (wait to see someone who would agree to open or just be single) and so there are three options.

It's the grown-up equivalent of \"well *everyone* knows _____.\u201d First of all, human psychology is a grossly under researched field (in comparison to physical sciences.) If you didn't read a decent study (decent in this context means, unbiased researchers, proper sample size, recent within the last 5-10 years, and hopefully not the first of its kind) that directly supports the argument, and you weren't an evolutionary biology major, I'm not sure where you're getting the \"well it's just biology\". According to....whom? Your inner thoughts and whatever part of your ass you're pulling facts from? There are certain common sense things I think \"it's just biology\" applies to: colorblind genes being on the y chromosome therefore effect more men than women. But using \"it's just biology\"for the entire existence and reasoning of two genders when humans and the human psyche are extremely complex entities that *no one* fully understands is a bullshit argument. Especially when no one is ever able to submit a source on this opinion (likely because it's a regurgitated fallacy.)\n\n Second of all, blaming biology for shitty behavior is childish at best.

So, for example, human history seems to suggest that monogamous pair-bonding is the expected behavior of humans for the last 10,000 years or so and  it may be useful to understand why. Conversely, history, psychology, and other scientific fields seem to show that humans are TERRIBLE at lifelong monogamy. Again, I think it's interesting to pursue the \"why\" of that. \n\nBut the study of human behavior and its \"whys\" is entirely different from ethics or morality. Those go more under the realm of philosophy or religion. I have an interest in both things. The last four years of my marriage, my wife didn't touch me, much less have sex with me. To this day I think religion fucked us both up in regards to sexuality. I ultimately took the only path I could, divorce, but that path was hard as hell and and created a huge amount of trauma for my kids and extended family that lasted more than 5 years. Now I don't regret getting divorced, but my experience has caused me to have a lot of compassion for men and women in sexless marriages. Our , yes, \"biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to depression and other forms of mental illness. \n\nTo circle back around to where I started, what I want to see is for the whole structure of marriage and the stupid, unrealistic expectation of lifelong monogamy to fucking go away. It doesn't work for the majority of humans. So if \"cheating \" is the least worst option for a person, I support them. I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.",

Biology describes tendencies, it is not a law. I would assume that ethics and morality play bigger parts in cheating and non-monogamy than biology, but since there's 0 research to attest to that, I won't make statements like \"cheating is a moral issue, not biology\"--because it's factually impossible to prove. The same way \"it's just biology\" is factually impossible to prove, and is therefore an incorrect and bullshit statement. I hope this better explains my stance on that statement.   \n\n\n>biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection  is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to  depression and other forms of mental illness.    \n\n\nI very much agree, so it confuses me to read other posters calling an entire gender babies or trash because they have human needs that refuse to be met by partners that supposedly care about them. Open relationships and polyamory aren't for everyone, and I would argue (as a person in an open marriage) that polyamory is not a life-long lifestyle for many people. So unfortunately, just \"leave them or have an open marriage but don't cheat\" is not valid advice.   \n\n\n> I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.    \n\n\nI am always surprised when people my age (mid twenties) get surprised/offended by our decision to be in an open relationship. Even more surprised when women who are entering a relationship with a self-identified married man (my husband) have opinions about the kind of person *I* am for being in an open marriage. Not him, the person they are sleeping with...but the other woman in the relationship.   \n\n\nWhile society has an impact on the views of polyamory and other forms of non-monogamy, I feel as though the onus is on the individuals to stay sane in a relationship. Sane people make better choices for what works best for them, their life, their partner, and their relationship. Non-monogamy as a concept is not a silver bullet, it depends on the individuals entering the relationship to be very clear and supportive with their partners.",

I would just like to point out that a lot more animals are promiscuous than are  monogamous, And that only one species of primate, which is what humans are, is monogamous. All the others, chimps, bonobos, gorillas etc. are promiscuous. Promiscuous, in this context is a scientific term describing animal sexual behavior, not a judgemental thing. I believe and I think the science bears out, that humans did not evolve with a sexuality involving monogamous pairing. There\u2019s a great book on this called Sex at Dawn, by Cacilda Jeth\u00e1 and Christopher Ryan. To enter into a long term relationship or a marriage vowing lifelong monogamy is foolish. I did something even more foolish, I made that vow on my wedding day and had never had sex with my wife. \u201cSaving yourself for marriage\u201d is literally one of the dumbest things that people can do and I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s restricted almost entirely to religious people.",

Do you think there may be instances where infidelity is the least-worst option?

Do you think divorce in that situation is more \"moral\" than infidelity? )\n\nI am divorced / single and don't have any skin in this game so I really am asking philosophically.",

I  believe polyamorous relationships fail at a greater rate than other relationships,  because anything based on sexual variety and pleasure is already on weak ground.   \n\nYour chronic disease scenario is a rare unusual case, and not the norm.  The question here is it ok to lie and deceive the most important person in your life because of some perceived benefit, mostly selfish?  No I don't think so.   Many adults of all ages have not had sex for years.   You won't die from it.   If the hand you're dealt is no more sex,  then no more sex.   Take care of your wife and grow from it.  If you can't handle it, pleasure yourself and use porn.  Because frankly,  f'ing around while your wife is slowly dying is pretty crappy.",

I think most people don't do that because they know deep inside it's a joke.\u201d \n\nThis begs a few questions.  First, are the vows at the ceremony the only ones that matter? The way you phrase it seems to imply that a couple can\u2019t change their agreement after they\u2019ve been married. For example they can\u2019t decide to open their marriage 10 years later. I\u2019m assuming that is not what you\u2019re saying because its a really really dumb idea. I also don\u2019t know what you mean when you say \u201cthey don\u2019t say that at the ceremony because they know deep down inside it\u2019s a joke\u201d. Do you know what\u2019s a joke? 20-somethings making a promise of lifelong monogamy. \n\nI endured four years of literally not beng touched by my wife. And because I didn\u2019t cheat during that time period, but looked at a lot of  porn and whacked off a lot, I feel like an expert on that subject. I know that having no physical touch or sex for years can literally drive you to depression, suicide and near insanity. So when I say something like you have to do whatever you have to do to stay sane and stay married I know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re pretty damn young, probably in your 20s. Because when I was in my 20s I was self-righteous as hell and religious. And I thought I was right about everything. The growth I have experience now that I am in my 50s is all centered around understanding that the world is complex and nuanced. Hopefully you will understand that one day too.",

There is a lot of evidence that before that event, humans did not pair bond, but rather behaved more like bonobos, with female-directed promiscuity being the norm. There is a lot of evidence for this, including the size and shape of the human penis, studies of modern isolated hunter-gatherer. But once we stopped wandering and started claiming property, it became necessary to be able to know paternity of children, which is how marriage and the concept of ownership of women came about.

Can you give me the lottery numbers for the next 10 years as well?   \n\n\nThe majority of men on this forum who brought up the idea of an open marriage with their spouse were shot down horribly and their wives made them feel like garbage for even asking.   \n\n\nCalling them cowards and assholes because they have needs that extend beyond food, sleep, and shelter is incorrect and far more asshole-ish behavior. Intimacy (not exclusively sex) is a human necessity so we all don't turn up like psychopaths. Refusing a necessity to your partner or refusing any sort of alternative is asshole behavior. Here's some examples of what caring about your partner looks like, along with one example of what not caring looks like:   \n\n\n* work to improve a need your partner feels is lacking \n* acknowledge your partner's issue and accept their proposed plan  \n\n* devise a solution where your partner gets more of what they feel is lacking, even if you don't put in more effort \n* ignore the partner's needs because the fact that they asked at all somehow hurts *your feelings* and the discussion turns into why *you* aren't good enough, instead of addressing the issue--he never brings it up again or if he does it's the same situation ad naseum until he figures out a way to get what he needs without purposefully hurting his partner  \n\n\nThe last is the most common, in my personal experience. I don't think anyone is a coward or a horrible person *solely* because they cheat. For all I know they have spoken to their wife about the idea of an open marriage and the wife responded in hysterics about the idea because the wife feels threatened, not good enough, depressed at her lack of libido, etc. Open relationships thrive on trust and communication more than monogamous relationships. If communication is close to perfect, open relationships are doomed to fail. I can understand why a partner with their own emotional baggage obfuscating communication would react that way. I can understand why the man would then cheat. It's far less painful than losing someone they love, but they have needs too. The wife is just as much in the wrong for not helping reach an agreement that benefits both parties and just putting her foot down and saying \"I don't care about *your* needs, I am not having sex with you and you are not having sex with anyone else.\" God, imagine if bills for the household were discussed the same way: Husband says wife isn't paying her share and they need a roof over their head, and she tells him because of her anxiety she can't work like she used to.  Husband gets an extra job without telling the wife, but tells her he gets a promotion at work so she isn't increasing her anxiety.  Is he a \"coward\" or \"asshole\" for lying to his wife about the extra income she refused to help with in the first place? I don't think so.",

If you didn't read a decent study (decent in this context means, unbiased researchers, proper sample size, recent within the last 5-10 years, and hopefully not the first of its kind) that directly supports the argument, and you weren't an evolutionary biology major, I'm not sure where you're getting the \"well it's just biology\". According to....whom? Your inner thoughts and whatever part of your ass you're pulling facts from? There are certain common sense things I think \"it's just biology\" applies to: colorblind genes being on the y chromosome therefore effect more men than women. But using \"it's just biology\"for the entire existence and reasoning of two genders when humans and the human psyche are extremely complex entities that *no one* fully understands is a bullshit argument. Especially when no one is ever able to submit a source on this opinion (likely because it's a regurgitated fallacy.)\n\n Second of all, blaming biology for shitty behavior is childish at best.

                            "body": "I think evolutionary biology may be, and probably is, useful to understand human behavior generally. So, for example, human history seems to suggest that monogamous pair-bonding is the expected behavior of humans for the last 10,000 years or so and  it may be useful to understand why. Conversely, history, psychology, and other scientific fields seem to show that humans are TERRIBLE at lifelong monogamy. Again, I think it's interesting to pursue the \"why\" of that. \n\nBut the study of human behavior and its \"whys\" is entirely different from ethics or morality. Those go more under the realm of philosophy or religion. I have an interest in both things. The last four years of my marriage, my wife didn't touch me, much less have sex with me. To this day I think religion fucked us both up in regards to sexuality. I ultimately took the only path I could, divorce, but that path was hard as hell and and created a huge amount of trauma for my kids and extended family that lasted more than 5 years. Now I don't regret getting divorced, but my experience has caused me to have a lot of compassion for men and women in sexless marriages. Our , yes, \"biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to depression and other forms of mental illness. \n\nTo circle back around to where I started, what I want to see is for the whole structure of marriage and the stupid, unrealistic expectation of lifelong monogamy to fucking go away. It doesn't work for the majority of humans. So if \"cheating \" is the least worst option for a person, I support them. I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.",

Biology describes tendencies, it is not a law. I would assume that ethics and morality play bigger parts in cheating and non-monogamy than biology, but since there's 0 research to attest to that, I won't make statements like \"cheating is a moral issue, not biology\"--because it's factually impossible to prove. The same way \"it's just biology\" is factually impossible to prove, and is therefore an incorrect and bullshit statement. I hope this better explains my stance on that statement.   \n\n\n>biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection  is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to  depression and other forms of mental illness.    \n\n\nI very much agree, so it confuses me to read other posters calling an entire gender babies or trash because they have human needs that refuse to be met by partners that supposedly care about them. Open relationships and polyamory aren't for everyone, and I would argue (as a person in an open marriage) that polyamory is not a life-long lifestyle for many people. So unfortunately, just \"leave them or have an open marriage but don't cheat\" is not valid advice.   \n\n\n> I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.    \n\n\nI am always surprised when people my age (mid twenties) get surprised/offended by our decision to be in an open relationship. Even more surprised when women who are entering a relationship with a self-identified married man (my husband) have opinions about the kind of person *I* am for being in an open marriage. Not him, the person they are sleeping with...but the other woman in the relationship.   \n\n\nWhile society has an impact on the views of polyamory and other forms of non-monogamy, I feel as though the onus is on the individuals to stay sane in a relationship. Sane people make better choices for what works best for them, their life, their partner, and their relationship. Non-monogamy as a concept is not a silver bullet, it depends on the individuals entering the relationship to be very clear and supportive with their partners.",

I agree with just about everything you say, including the idea that open relationships and polyamory are not silver bullets, but I do think the social and societal change that marriage and lifelong monogamy to one partner is no longer the only expectation or norm is moving in the right direction. One of many positive changes regarding sexuality to come about in the last few decades.",

All the others, chimps, bonobos, gorillas etc. are promiscuous. Promiscuous, in this context is a scientific term describing animal sexual behavior, not a judgemental thing. I believe and I think the science bears out, that humans did not evolve with a sexuality involving monogamous pairing. There\u2019s a great book on this called Sex at Dawn, by Cacilda Jeth\u00e1 and Christopher Ryan. To enter into a long term relationship or a marriage vowing lifelong monogamy is foolish. I did something even more foolish, I made that vow on my wedding day and had never had sex with my wife. \u201cSaving yourself for marriage\u201d is literally one of the dumbest things that people can do and I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s restricted almost entirely to religious people.",

I think most people don't do that because they know deep inside it's a joke.\u201d \n\nThis begs a few questions.  First, are the vows at the ceremony the only ones that matter? The way you phrase it seems to imply that a couple can\u2019t change their agreement after they\u2019ve been married. For example they can\u2019t decide to open their marriage 10 years later. I\u2019m assuming that is not what you\u2019re saying because its a really really dumb idea. I also don\u2019t know what you mean when you say \u201cthey don\u2019t say that at the ceremony because they know deep down inside it\u2019s a joke\u201d. Do you know what\u2019s a joke? 20-somethings making a promise of lifelong monogamy. \n\nI endured four years of literally not beng touched by my wife. And because I didn\u2019t cheat during that time period, but looked at a lot of  porn and whacked off a lot, I feel like an expert on that subject. I know that having no physical touch or sex for years can literally drive you to depression, suicide and near insanity. So when I say something like you have to do whatever you have to do to stay sane and stay married I know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re pretty damn young, probably in your 20s. Because when I was in my 20s I was self-righteous as hell and religious. And I thought I was right about everything. The growth I have experience now that I am in my 50s is all centered around understanding that the world is complex and nuanced. Hopefully you will understand that one day too.",

That one change is probably the most important development in the history of our species. Before then, there was no \"property\", just clans hunting and gathering to survive. There is a lot of evidence that before that event, humans did not pair bond, but rather behaved more like bonobos, with female-directed promiscuity being the norm. There is a lot of evidence for this, including the size and shape of the human penis, studies of modern isolated hunter-gatherer. But once we stopped wandering and started claiming property, it became necessary to be able to know paternity of children, which is how marriage and the concept of ownership of women came about. The truth is, for most of the history of marriage, it was a property contract and the beginning of \"the patriarchy\". Monogamy and marriage fit together like hand and glove. I always find it interesting when women defend marriage. If only they understood the history of the institution.",

Can you give me the lottery numbers for the next 10 years as well?   \n\n\nThe majority of men on this forum who brought up the idea of an open marriage with their spouse were shot down horribly and their wives made them feel like garbage for even asking.   \n\n\nCalling them cowards and assholes because they have needs that extend beyond food, sleep, and shelter is incorrect and far more asshole-ish behavior. Intimacy (not exclusively sex) is a human necessity so we all don't turn up like psychopaths. Refusing a necessity to your partner or refusing any sort of alternative is asshole behavior. Here's some examples of what caring about your partner looks like, along with one example of what not caring looks like:   \n\n\n* work to improve a need your partner feels is lacking \n* acknowledge your partner's issue and accept their proposed plan  \n\n* devise a solution where your partner gets more of what they feel is lacking, even if you don't put in more effort \n* ignore the partner's needs because the fact that they asked at all somehow hurts *your feelings* and the discussion turns into why *you* aren't good enough, instead of addressing the issue--he never brings it up again or if he does it's the same situation ad naseum until he figures out a way to get what he needs without purposefully hurting his partner  \n\n\nThe last is the most common, in my personal experience. I don't think anyone is a coward or a horrible person *solely* because they cheat. For all I know they have spoken to their wife about the idea of an open marriage and the wife responded in hysterics about the idea because the wife feels threatened, not good enough, depressed at her lack of libido, etc. Open relationships thrive on trust and communication more than monogamous relationships. If communication is close to perfect, open relationships are doomed to fail. I can understand why a partner with their own emotional baggage obfuscating communication would react that way. I can understand why the man would then cheat. It's far less painful than losing someone they love, but they have needs too. The wife is just as much in the wrong for not helping reach an agreement that benefits both parties and just putting her foot down and saying \"I don't care about *your* needs, I am not having sex with you and you are not having sex with anyone else.\" God, imagine if bills for the household were discussed the same way: Husband says wife isn't paying her share and they need a roof over their head, and she tells him because of her anxiety she can't work like she used to.  Husband gets an extra job without telling the wife, but tells her he gets a promotion at work so she isn't increasing her anxiety.  Is he a \"coward\" or \"asshole\" for lying to his wife about the extra income she refused to help with in the first place? I don't think so.",

An open relationship or no relationship is always on the table (wait to see someone who would agree to open or just be single) and so there are three options. People opt for one of of the two you mentioned for social/cultural reasons and so the cause of *cheating* is social/cultural. A man who would cheat but not allow his wife to see other men is not being driven by biology, he is being driven by his ego.

It's the grown-up equivalent of \"well *everyone* knows _____.\u201d First of all, human psychology is a grossly under researched field (in comparison to physical sciences.) If you didn't read a decent study (decent in this context means, unbiased researchers, proper sample size, recent within the last 5-10 years, and hopefully not the first of its kind) that directly supports the argument, and you weren't an evolutionary biology major, I'm not sure where you're getting the \"well it's just biology\". According to....whom? Your inner thoughts and whatever part of your ass you're pulling facts from? There are certain common sense things I think \"it's just biology\" applies to: colorblind genes being on the y chromosome therefore effect more men than women. But using \"it's just biology\"for the entire existence and reasoning of two genders when humans and the human psyche are extremely complex entities that *no one* fully understands is a bullshit argument. Especially when no one is ever able to submit a source on this opinion (likely because it's a regurgitated fallacy.)\n\n Second of all, blaming biology for shitty behavior is childish at best.

                    "body": "I think evolutionary biology may be, and probably is, useful to understand human behavior generally. So, for example, human history seems to suggest that monogamous pair-bonding is the expected behavior of humans for the last 10,000 years or so and  it may be useful to understand why. Conversely, history, psychology, and other scientific fields seem to show that humans are TERRIBLE at lifelong monogamy. Again, I think it's interesting to pursue the \"why\" of that. \n\nBut the study of human behavior and its \"whys\" is entirely different from ethics or morality. Those go more under the realm of philosophy or religion. I have an interest in both things. The last four years of my marriage, my wife didn't touch me, much less have sex with me. To this day I think religion fucked us both up in regards to sexuality. I ultimately took the only path I could, divorce, but that path was hard as hell and and created a huge amount of trauma for my kids and extended family that lasted more than 5 years. Now I don't regret getting divorced, but my experience has caused me to have a lot of compassion for men and women in sexless marriages. Our , yes, \"biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to depression and other forms of mental illness. \n\nTo circle back around to where I started, what I want to see is for the whole structure of marriage and the stupid, unrealistic expectation of lifelong monogamy to fucking go away. It doesn't work for the majority of humans. So if \"cheating \" is the least worst option for a person, I support them. I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.",

Biology describes tendencies, it is not a law. I would assume that ethics and morality play bigger parts in cheating and non-monogamy than biology, but since there's 0 research to attest to that, I won't make statements like \"cheating is a moral issue, not biology\"--because it's factually impossible to prove. The same way \"it's just biology\" is factually impossible to prove, and is therefore an incorrect and bullshit statement. I hope this better explains my stance on that statement.   \n\n\n>biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection  is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to  depression and other forms of mental illness.    \n\n\nI very much agree, so it confuses me to read other posters calling an entire gender babies or trash because they have human needs that refuse to be met by partners that supposedly care about them. Open relationships and polyamory aren't for everyone, and I would argue (as a person in an open marriage) that polyamory is not a life-long lifestyle for many people. So unfortunately, just \"leave them or have an open marriage but don't cheat\" is not valid advice.   \n\n\n> I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.    \n\n\nI am always surprised when people my age (mid twenties) get surprised/offended by our decision to be in an open relationship. Even more surprised when women who are entering a relationship with a self-identified married man (my husband) have opinions about the kind of person *I* am for being in an open marriage. Not him, the person they are sleeping with...but the other woman in the relationship.   \n\n\nWhile society has an impact on the views of polyamory and other forms of non-monogamy, I feel as though the onus is on the individuals to stay sane in a relationship. Sane people make better choices for what works best for them, their life, their partner, and their relationship. Non-monogamy as a concept is not a silver bullet, it depends on the individuals entering the relationship to be very clear and supportive with their partners.",

I\u2019m assuming that is not what you\u2019re saying because its a really really dumb idea.

And because I didn\u2019t cheat during that time period, but looked at a lot of  porn and whacked off a lot, I feel like an expert on that subject. I know that having no physical touch or sex for years can literally drive you to depression, suicide and near insanity. So when I say something like you have to do whatever you have to do to stay sane and stay married I know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re pretty damn young, probably in your 20s. Because when I was in my 20s I was self-righteous as hell and religious. And I thought I was right about everything.

That one change is probably the most important development in the history of our species. Before then, there was no \"property\", just clans hunting and gathering to survive. There is a lot of evidence that before that event, humans did not pair bond, but rather behaved more like bonobos, with female-directed promiscuity being the norm. There is a lot of evidence for this, including the size and shape of the human penis, studies of modern isolated hunter-gatherer. But once we stopped wandering and started claiming property, it became necessary to be able to know paternity of children, which is how marriage and the concept of ownership of women came about. The truth is, for most of the history of marriage, it was a property contract and the beginning of \"the patriarchy\". Monogamy and marriage fit together like hand and glove. I always find it interesting when women defend marriage. If only they understood the history of the institution.",

Can you give me the lottery numbers for the next 10 years as well?   \n\n\nThe majority of men on this forum who brought up the idea of an open marriage with their spouse were shot down horribly and their wives made them feel like garbage for even asking.   \n\n\nCalling them cowards and assholes because they have needs that extend beyond food, sleep, and shelter is incorrect and far more asshole-ish behavior. Intimacy (not exclusively sex) is a human necessity so we all don't turn up like psychopaths. Refusing a necessity to your partner or refusing any sort of alternative is asshole behavior. Here's some examples of what caring about your partner looks like, along with one example of what not caring looks like:   \n\n\n* work to improve a need your partner feels is lacking \n* acknowledge your partner's issue and accept their proposed plan  \n\n* devise a solution where your partner gets more of what they feel is lacking, even if you don't put in more effort \n* ignore the partner's needs because the fact that they asked at all somehow hurts *your feelings* and the discussion turns into why *you* aren't good enough, instead of addressing the issue--he never brings it up again or if he does it's the same situation ad naseum until he figures out a way to get what he needs without purposefully hurting his partner  \n\n\nThe last is the most common, in my personal experience. I don't think anyone is a coward or a horrible person *solely* because they cheat. For all I know they have spoken to their wife about the idea of an open marriage and the wife responded in hysterics about the idea because the wife feels threatened, not good enough, depressed at her lack of libido, etc. Open relationships thrive on trust and communication more than monogamous relationships. If communication is close to perfect, open relationships are doomed to fail. I can understand why a partner with their own emotional baggage obfuscating communication would react that way. I can understand why the man would then cheat. It's far less painful than losing someone they love, but they have needs too. The wife is just as much in the wrong for not helping reach an agreement that benefits both parties and just putting her foot down and saying \"I don't care about *your* needs, I am not having sex with you and you are not having sex with anyone else.\" God, imagine if bills for the household were discussed the same way: Husband says wife isn't paying her share and they need a roof over their head, and she tells him because of her anxiety she can't work like she used to.  Husband gets an extra job without telling the wife, but tells her he gets a promotion at work so she isn't increasing her anxiety.  Is he a \"coward\" or \"asshole\" for lying to his wife about the extra income she refused to help with in the first place? I don't think so.",

So, for example, human history seems to suggest that monogamous pair-bonding is the expected behavior of humans for the last 10,000 years or so and  it may be useful to understand why. Conversely, history, psychology, and other scientific fields seem to show that humans are TERRIBLE at lifelong monogamy. Again, I think it's interesting to pursue the \"why\" of that. \n\nBut the study of human behavior and its \"whys\" is entirely different from ethics or morality. Those go more under the realm of philosophy or religion. I have an interest in both things. The last four years of my marriage, my wife didn't touch me, much less have sex with me. To this day I think religion fucked us both up in regards to sexuality. I ultimately took the only path I could, divorce, but that path was hard as hell and and created a huge amount of trauma for my kids and extended family that lasted more than 5 years. Now I don't regret getting divorced, but my experience has caused me to have a lot of compassion for men and women in sexless marriages. Our , yes, \"biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to depression and other forms of mental illness. \n\nTo circle back around to where I started, what I want to see is for the whole structure of marriage and the stupid, unrealistic expectation of lifelong monogamy to fucking go away. It doesn't work for the majority of humans. So if \"cheating \" is the least worst option for a person, I support them. I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.",

Biology describes tendencies, it is not a law. I would assume that ethics and morality play bigger parts in cheating and non-monogamy than biology, but since there's 0 research to attest to that, I won't make statements like \"cheating is a moral issue, not biology\"--because it's factually impossible to prove. The same way \"it's just biology\" is factually impossible to prove, and is therefore an incorrect and bullshit statement. I hope this better explains my stance on that statement.   \n\n\n>biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection  is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to  depression and other forms of mental illness.    \n\n\nI very much agree, so it confuses me to read other posters calling an entire gender babies or trash because they have human needs that refuse to be met by partners that supposedly care about them. Open relationships and polyamory aren't for everyone, and I would argue (as a person in an open marriage) that polyamory is not a life-long lifestyle for many people. So unfortunately, just \"leave them or have an open marriage but don't cheat\" is not valid advice.   \n\n\n> I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.    \n\n\nI am always surprised when people my age (mid twenties) get surprised/offended by our decision to be in an open relationship. Even more surprised when women who are entering a relationship with a self-identified married man (my husband) have opinions about the kind of person *I* am for being in an open marriage. Not him, the person they are sleeping with...but the other woman in the relationship.   \n\n\nWhile society has an impact on the views of polyamory and other forms of non-monogamy, I feel as though the onus is on the individuals to stay sane in a relationship. Sane people make better choices for what works best for them, their life, their partner, and their relationship. Non-monogamy as a concept is not a silver bullet, it depends on the individuals entering the relationship to be very clear and supportive with their partners.",

As primates, humans are much closer to Bonobos and Chimps, which are promiscuous, than Gibbons,  I really believe that our species did not pair bond until about 10,000 years ago with the advent of agriculture / property.\n\nBut really the questions I want to ask you are:\n\n1. Do you think lifelong monogamy with one partner is the only acceptable option for people? Or are you comfortable with serial monogamy?\n2. How do you feel about polyamory and open relationships?\n3. Do you think there may be instances where infidelity is the least-worst option? (For example, a man has spent a decade taking care of a wife dying of a chronic disease and hasn't experienced affectionate human touch in 5 years and is insane / suicidal with need? Do you think divorce in that situation is more \"moral\" than infidelity? )\n\nI am divorced / single and don't have any skin in this game so I really am asking philosophically.",

If you want an open marriage ,  say it in the marriage vows at the ceremony.  I think most people don't do that because they know deep inside it's a joke.    I  believe polyamorous relationships fail at a greater rate than other relationships,  because anything based on sexual variety and pleasure is already on weak ground.   \n\nYour chronic disease scenario is a rare unusual case, and not the norm.  The question here is it ok to lie and deceive the most important person in your life because of some perceived benefit, mostly selfish?  No I don't think so.   Many adults of all ages have not had sex for years.   You won't die from it.   If the hand you're dealt is no more sex,  then no more sex.   Take care of your wife and grow from it.  If you can't handle it, pleasure yourself and use porn.  Because frankly,  f'ing around while your wife is slowly dying is pretty crappy.",

I think most people don't do that because they know deep inside it's a joke.\u201d \n\nThis begs a few questions.  First, are the vows at the ceremony the only ones that matter? The way you phrase it seems to imply that a couple can\u2019t change their agreement after they\u2019ve been married. For example they can\u2019t decide to open their marriage 10 years later. I\u2019m assuming that is not what you\u2019re saying because its a really really dumb idea. I also don\u2019t know what you mean when you say \u201cthey don\u2019t say that at the ceremony because they know deep down inside it\u2019s a joke\u201d. Do you know what\u2019s a joke? 20-somethings making a promise of lifelong monogamy. \n\nI endured four years of literally not beng touched by my wife. And because I didn\u2019t cheat during that time period, but looked at a lot of  porn and whacked off a lot, I feel like an expert on that subject. I know that having no physical touch or sex for years can literally drive you to depression, suicide and near insanity. So when I say something like you have to do whatever you have to do to stay sane and stay married I know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re pretty damn young, probably in your 20s. Because when I was in my 20s I was self-righteous as hell and religious. And I thought I was right about everything. The growth I have experience now that I am in my 50s is all centered around understanding that the world is complex and nuanced. Hopefully you will understand that one day too.",

Even the Catholic Church as rigid as they are,  would have allowed you to annul your marriage, if your wife was withholding sex.\n\nAnd don't apply your situation as a benchmark for all of history.   Yes, the current state of affairs is sad,  but it wasn't always that way.  Many people (many of our parents and grandparents) , mostly 20 somethings and younger, in the US and other countries in prior decades had successful monogamous marriages.\n\nAnd yes, open marriages are a farce.   When you start saying sex with other people is the key to being happy,  you're doomed,  because love is sacrifice and commitment  and no part of that equation shows that.  It's placing so large a value on something that loses it's appeal as we age.\n\nI'm sorry you suffered, but in the end,  do you believe in integrity.

That one change is probably the most important development in the history of our species. Before then, there was no \"property\", just clans hunting and gathering to survive. There is a lot of evidence that before that event, humans did not pair bond, but rather behaved more like bonobos, with female-directed promiscuity being the norm. There is a lot of evidence for this, including the size and shape of the human penis, studies of modern isolated hunter-gatherer. But once we stopped wandering and started claiming property, it became necessary to be able to know paternity of children, which is how marriage and the concept of ownership of women came about. The truth is, for most of the history of marriage, it was a property contract and the beginning of \"the patriarchy\". Monogamy and marriage fit together like hand and glove. I always find it interesting when women defend marriage. If only they understood the history of the institution.",

Can you give me the lottery numbers for the next 10 years as well?   \n\n\nThe majority of men on this forum who brought up the idea of an open marriage with their spouse were shot down horribly and their wives made them feel like garbage for even asking.   \n\n\nCalling them cowards and assholes because they have needs that extend beyond food, sleep, and shelter is incorrect and far more asshole-ish behavior. Intimacy (not exclusively sex) is a human necessity so we all don't turn up like psychopaths. Refusing a necessity to your partner or refusing any sort of alternative is asshole behavior. Here's some examples of what caring about your partner looks like, along with one example of what not caring looks like:   \n\n\n* work to improve a need your partner feels is lacking \n* acknowledge your partner's issue and accept their proposed plan  \n\n* devise a solution where your partner gets more of what they feel is lacking, even if you don't put in more effort \n* ignore the partner's needs because the fact that they asked at all somehow hurts *your feelings* and the discussion turns into why *you* aren't good enough, instead of addressing the issue--he never brings it up again or if he does it's the same situation ad naseum until he figures out a way to get what he needs without purposefully hurting his partner  \n\n\nThe last is the most common, in my personal experience. I don't think anyone is a coward or a horrible person *solely* because they cheat. For all I know they have spoken to their wife about the idea of an open marriage and the wife responded in hysterics about the idea because the wife feels threatened, not good enough, depressed at her lack of libido, etc. Open relationships thrive on trust and communication more than monogamous relationships. If communication is close to perfect, open relationships are doomed to fail. I can understand why a partner with their own emotional baggage obfuscating communication would react that way. I can understand why the man would then cheat. It's far less painful than losing someone they love, but they have needs too. The wife is just as much in the wrong for not helping reach an agreement that benefits both parties and just putting her foot down and saying \"I don't care about *your* needs, I am not having sex with you and you are not having sex with anyone else.\" God, imagine if bills for the household were discussed the same way: Husband says wife isn't paying her share and they need a roof over their head, and she tells him because of her anxiety she can't work like she used to.  Husband gets an extra job without telling the wife, but tells her he gets a promotion at work so she isn't increasing her anxiety.  Is he a \"coward\" or \"asshole\" for lying to his wife about the extra income she refused to help with in the first place? I don't think so.",

Biology describes tendencies, it is not a law. I would assume that ethics and morality play bigger parts in cheating and non-monogamy than biology, but since there's 0 research to attest to that, I won't make statements like \"cheating is a moral issue, not biology\"--because it's factually impossible to prove. The same way \"it's just biology\" is factually impossible to prove, and is therefore an incorrect and bullshit statement. I hope this better explains my stance on that statement.   \n\n\n>biological and evolutionary need\" for sex, physical touch and affection  is so great, that not having it for months and years can lead to  depression and other forms of mental illness.    \n\n\nI very much agree, so it confuses me to read other posters calling an entire gender babies or trash because they have human needs that refuse to be met by partners that supposedly care about them. Open relationships and polyamory aren't for everyone, and I would argue (as a person in an open marriage) that polyamory is not a life-long lifestyle for many people. So unfortunately, just \"leave them or have an open marriage but don't cheat\" is not valid advice.   \n\n\n> I just look forward to the day when non-monogamy is so normal that no one will have to lie to their partner to stay sane.    \n\n\nI am always surprised when people my age (mid twenties) get surprised/offended by our decision to be in an open relationship. Even more surprised when women who are entering a relationship with a self-identified married man (my husband) have opinions about the kind of person *I* am for being in an open marriage. Not him, the person they are sleeping with...but the other woman in the relationship.   \n\n\nWhile society has an impact on the views of polyamory and other forms of non-monogamy, I feel as though the onus is on the individuals to stay sane in a relationship. Sane people make better choices for what works best for them, their life, their partner, and their relationship. Non-monogamy as a concept is not a silver bullet, it depends on the individuals entering the relationship to be very clear and supportive with their partners.",

The question here is it ok to lie and deceive the most important person in your life because of some perceived benefit, mostly selfish?  No I don't think so.   Many adults of all ages have not had sex for years.   You won't die from it.   If the hand you're dealt is no more sex,  then no more sex.   Take care of your wife and grow from it.  If you can't handle it, pleasure yourself and use porn.  Because frankly,  f'ing around while your wife is slowly dying is pretty crappy.",

I think most people don't do that because they know deep inside it's a joke.\u201d \n\nThis begs a few questions.  First, are the vows at the ceremony the only ones that matter? The way you phrase it seems to imply that a couple can\u2019t change their agreement after they\u2019ve been married. For example they can\u2019t decide to open their marriage 10 years later. I\u2019m assuming that is not what you\u2019re saying because its a really really dumb idea. I also don\u2019t know what you mean when you say \u201cthey don\u2019t say that at the ceremony because they know deep down inside it\u2019s a joke\u201d. Do you know what\u2019s a joke? 20-somethings making a promise of lifelong monogamy. \n\nI endured four years of literally not beng touched by my wife. And because I didn\u2019t cheat during that time period, but looked at a lot of  porn and whacked off a lot, I feel like an expert on that subject. I know that having no physical touch or sex for years can literally drive you to depression, suicide and near insanity. So when I say something like you have to do whatever you have to do to stay sane and stay married I know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re pretty damn young, probably in your 20s. Because when I was in my 20s I was self-righteous as hell and religious. And I thought I was right about everything. The growth I have experience now that I am in my 50s is all centered around understanding that the world is complex and nuanced. Hopefully you will understand that one day too.",

Can you give me the lottery numbers for the next 10 years as well?   \n\n\nThe majority of men on this forum who brought up the idea of an open marriage with their spouse were shot down horribly and their wives made them feel like garbage for even asking.   \n\n\nCalling them cowards and assholes because they have needs that extend beyond food, sleep, and shelter is incorrect and far more asshole-ish behavior. Intimacy (not exclusively sex) is a human necessity so we all don't turn up like psychopaths. Refusing a necessity to your partner or refusing any sort of alternative is asshole behavior. Here's some examples of what caring about your partner looks like, along with one example of what not caring looks like:   \n\n\n* work to improve a need your partner feels is lacking \n* acknowledge your partner's issue and accept their proposed plan  \n\n* devise a solution where your partner gets more of what they feel is lacking, even if you don't put in more effort \n* ignore the partner's needs because the fact that they asked at all somehow hurts *your feelings* and the discussion turns into why *you* aren't good enough, instead of addressing the issue--he never brings it up again or if he does it's the same situation ad naseum until he figures out a way to get what he needs without purposefully hurting his partner  \n\n\nThe last is the most common, in my personal experience. I don't think anyone is a coward or a horrible person *solely* because they cheat. For all I know they have spoken to their wife about the idea of an open marriage and the wife responded in hysterics about the idea because the wife feels threatened, not good enough, depressed at her lack of libido, etc. Open relationships thrive on trust and communication more than monogamous relationships. If communication is close to perfect, open relationships are doomed to fail. I can understand why a partner with their own emotional baggage obfuscating communication would react that way. I can understand why the man would then cheat. It's far less painful than losing someone they love, but they have needs too. The wife is just as much in the wrong for not helping reach an agreement that benefits both parties and just putting her foot down and saying \"I don't care about *your* needs, I am not having sex with you and you are not having sex with anyone else.\" God, imagine if bills for the household were discussed the same way: Husband says wife isn't paying her share and they need a roof over their head, and she tells him because of her anxiety she can't work like she used to.  Husband gets an extra job without telling the wife, but tells her he gets a promotion at work so she isn't increasing her anxiety.  Is he a \"coward\" or \"asshole\" for lying to his wife about the extra income she refused to help with in the first place? I don't think so.",

An open relationship or no relationship is always on the table (wait to see someone who would agree to open or just be single) and so there are three options.

I think most people don't do that because they know deep inside it's a joke.\u201d \n\nThis begs a few questions.  First, are the vows at the ceremony the only ones that matter? The way you phrase it seems to imply that a couple can\u2019t change their agreement after they\u2019ve been married. For example they can\u2019t decide to open their marriage 10 years later. I\u2019m assuming that is not what you\u2019re saying because its a really really dumb idea. I also don\u2019t know what you mean when you say \u201cthey don\u2019t say that at the ceremony because they know deep down inside it\u2019s a joke\u201d. Do you know what\u2019s a joke? 20-somethings making a promise of lifelong monogamy. \n\nI endured four years of literally not beng touched by my wife. And because I didn\u2019t cheat during that time period, but looked at a lot of  porn and whacked off a lot, I feel like an expert on that subject. I know that having no physical touch or sex for years can literally drive you to depression, suicide and near insanity. So when I say something like you have to do whatever you have to do to stay sane and stay married I know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re pretty damn young, probably in your 20s. Because when I was in my 20s I was self-righteous as hell and religious. And I thought I was right about everything. The growth I have experience now that I am in my 50s is all centered around understanding that the world is complex and nuanced. Hopefully you will understand that one day too.",

An open relationship or no relationship is always on the table (wait to see someone who would agree to open or just be single) and so there are three options. People opt for one of of the two you mentioned for social/cultural reasons and so the cause of *cheating* is social/cultural. A man who would cheat but not allow his wife to see other men is not being driven by biology, he is being driven by his ego.

If you make a legal contract and break it,  a Court of Law will punish you.   If you Lie to a Judge and get caught,  a Court of Law will Punish you.
