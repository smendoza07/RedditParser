Although it\u2019s not a tailed beast or dojutsu it is a natural enhancement. Guy dies after reaching his strongest and wouldn\u2019t put a candle to naruto and sasuke although admittedly he\u2019s one of the strongest. Tsunade is senju so large chakra reserves naturally again. Orochimaru got strong through running experiments on kids so I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a good example here.

He gets disheartened because he sees someone like Sasuke who worked hard but because of his natural gifts didn't need to spend anywhere near as much time as Lee whole training.\n\nThe point Kishimoto was making was that just because other people are more talented doesn't mean you shouldn't work hard because while you may never reach their potential, you never know how great you will be unless you try. I mean Guy quite literally says that when Lee questions everything.\n\nSomehow the fanbase took that and twisted it into the most basic Shonen trope of \"hardwork beats everything\".",

He himself is insanely strong, he nearly broke out of Orochimaru's reanimation (putting that substantially above him) and was able to take some shots at Juubito.\n\nHiruzen is relative to or above Tobirama, was stated to be the strongest kage when he died. Fought off the strongest Sannin, was able to outspeed Tobirama in the war arc.\n\nMinato's a beast, was able to combat and counter Kamui in one fight. Took on the eight tails jinchuriki and fourth raikage in their prime and won. Can teleport away a Bijuu bomb. I'd argue he can take on the entire akatsuki and win.\n\nTsunade has insane strength feats breaking madara's susanoo. She's probably the weakest hokage but she can nuke a city with a punch.\n\nKakashi's war arc feats put his reaction speed relative to KCM2 minato and combat speed to white-mask obito. He has insane feats in the novel, he could likely take on the akatsuki himself too.\n\nNaruto doesn't need an explanation.",

He gets disheartened because he sees someone like Sasuke who worked hard but because of his natural gifts didn't need to spend anywhere near as much time as Lee whole training.\n\nThe point Kishimoto was making was that just because other people are more talented doesn't mean you shouldn't work hard because while you may never reach their potential, you never know how great you will be unless you try. I mean Guy quite literally says that when Lee questions everything.\n\nSomehow the fanbase took that and twisted it into the most basic Shonen trope of \"hardwork beats everything\".",

Fought off the strongest Sannin, was able to outspeed Tobirama in the war arc.\n\nMinato's a beast, was able to combat and counter Kamui in one fight. Took on the eight tails jinchuriki and fourth raikage in their prime and won. Can teleport away a Bijuu bomb. I'd argue he can take on the entire akatsuki and win.\n\nTsunade has insane strength feats breaking madara's susanoo.

He gets disheartened because he sees someone like Sasuke who worked hard but because of his natural gifts didn't need to spend anywhere near as much time as Lee whole training.\n\nThe point Kishimoto was making was that just because other people are more talented doesn't mean you shouldn't work hard because while you may never reach their potential, you never know how great you will be unless you try. I mean Guy quite literally says that when Lee questions everything.\n\nSomehow the fanbase took that and twisted it into the most basic Shonen trope of \"hardwork beats everything\".",

He himself is insanely strong, he nearly broke out of Orochimaru's reanimation (putting that substantially above him) and was able to take some shots at Juubito.\n\nHiruzen is relative to or above Tobirama, was stated to be the strongest kage when he died. Fought off the strongest Sannin, was able to outspeed Tobirama in the war arc.\n\nMinato's a beast, was able to combat and counter Kamui in one fight. Took on the eight tails jinchuriki and fourth raikage in their prime and won. Can teleport away a Bijuu bomb. I'd argue he can take on the entire akatsuki and win.\n\nTsunade has insane strength feats breaking madara's susanoo. She's probably the weakest hokage but she can nuke a city with a punch.\n\nKakashi's war arc feats put his reaction speed relative to KCM2 minato and combat speed to white-mask obito.

Lee lost his fight to Gaara and had to sit on the sidelines and watch everyone get stronger.\n\nLee's entire struggle is based around him trying to prove to the world that he can be a great shinobi just based off his taijutsu alone. He gets disheartened because he sees someone like Sasuke who worked hard but because of his natural gifts didn't need to spend anywhere near as much time as Lee whole training.\n\nThe point Kishimoto was making was that just because other people are more talented doesn't mean you shouldn't work hard because while you may never reach their potential, you never know how great you will be unless you try. I mean Guy quite literally says that when Lee questions everything.\n\nSomehow the fanbase took that and twisted it into the most basic Shonen trope of \"hardwork beats everything\".",

He gets disheartened because he sees someone like Sasuke who worked hard but because of his natural gifts didn't need to spend anywhere near as much time as Lee whole training.\n\nThe point Kishimoto was making was that just because other people are more talented doesn't mean you shouldn't work hard because while you may never reach their potential, you never know how great you will be unless you try. I mean Guy quite literally says that when Lee questions everything.\n\nSomehow the fanbase took that and twisted it into the most basic Shonen trope of \"hardwork beats everything\".",

He gets disheartened because he sees someone like Sasuke who worked hard but because of his natural gifts didn't need to spend anywhere near as much time as Lee whole training.\n\nThe point Kishimoto was making was that just because other people are more talented doesn't mean you shouldn't work hard because while you may never reach their potential, you never know how great you will be unless you try. I mean Guy quite literally says that when Lee questions everything.\n\nSomehow the fanbase took that and twisted it into the most basic Shonen trope of \"hardwork beats everything\".",

Lee lost his fight to Gaara and had to sit on the sidelines and watch everyone get stronger.\n\nLee's entire struggle is based around him trying to prove to the world that he can be a great shinobi just based off his taijutsu alone. He gets disheartened because he sees someone like Sasuke who worked hard but because of his natural gifts didn't need to spend anywhere near as much time as Lee whole training.\n\nThe point Kishimoto was making was that just because other people are more talented doesn't mean you shouldn't work hard because while you may never reach their potential, you never know how great you will be unless you try. I mean Guy quite literally says that when Lee questions everything.\n\nSomehow the fanbase took that and twisted it into the most basic Shonen trope of \"hardwork beats everything\".",
