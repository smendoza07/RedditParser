You're someone who would benefit greatly from a beard. It would really balance your face out and that alone would increase your attractiveness. It also works on eyebrows if that's something that bothers you, but I don't think you really need it.\n\nCareful. Some people can't properly grow a beard and will take this advice to heart and will still attempt to grow said beard; however it'll look terrible. (i.e. neckbeards)",

Minoxidil will help existing follicles thicken and grow. Some hairs are super thin and unnoticeable (and I'm not sure about this but I'd assume since balding causes hair to thin to the point it can't penetrate skin, there may be cheek hairs that are too thin to surface that will become thick enough to grow). These are the hairs that will become thicker and grow. \n\nTake a close look, if you're mid 20s andand you've got a lot of empty patches of skin in the beard region, there is nothing there for minoxidil to work on. Hairs will not just appear so don't get your hopes up.\n\nThat said, I had patches and very little growth and a few months in I have noticeable growth on the cheeks and I can see more tiny hairs that should probably start thickening up in a few months",

Plus, you can do 5 frames at a time over and over with no commitments. They have some really stylish half frames you might like based on your current pick. \n3. Get the sides cleaned up and part it to the side. It\u2019s a classic look. Play with the length on top at your discretion. Ask your hairdresser to tell you info about the products they chose to style it with, too! If you don\u2019t feel comfortable with salon prices (I sure don\u2019t) just buy cheap drugstore dupes. Consider a shampoo that specifically mentions volumizing on it. Typically you\u2019ll have to buy shampoo marketed towards females and smells like flowers and that\u2019s okay. \n4. Cetaphil face wash and Cetaphil lotion! My nose has the same dryness around it like that.\n5. Embrace your pallor! Tanning is costly and damaging to your skin. \n\nBonus 6. Well-fitting, fresh clothing makes all the difference! If you look at people that tend to be super stylish and conventionally attractive, they\u2019re oftentimes wearing simple t-shirts and jeans, but well-fitting. Not too baggy, not too tight. Look at the size guides for brands and measure yourself. Keep it you. I like muted colors and navy tends to look awesome with your skin tone.\n\nJust have fun and don\u2019t take it all too seriously. Enjoy yourself. :)",

            "body": "> 1) Looking into minoxidil beards. If you don't have heart problems, this can give you a great, full beard in 6 months - year. It's a big commitment, but it 100% works. You're someone who would benefit greatly from a beard. It would really balance your face out and that alone would increase your attractiveness. It also works on eyebrows if that's something that bothers you, but I don't think you really need it.\n\nCareful. Some people can't properly grow a beard and will take this advice to heart and will still attempt to grow said beard; however it'll look terrible. (i.e. neckbeards)",

Minoxidil will help existing follicles thicken and grow. Some hairs are super thin and unnoticeable (and I'm not sure about this but I'd assume since balding causes hair to thin to the point it can't penetrate skin, there may be cheek hairs that are too thin to surface that will become thick enough to grow). These are the hairs that will become thicker and grow. \n\nTake a close look, if you're mid 20s andand you've got a lot of empty patches of skin in the beard region, there is nothing there for minoxidil to work on. Hairs will not just appear so don't get your hopes up.\n\nThat said, I had patches and very little growth and a few months in I have noticeable growth on the cheeks and I can see more tiny hairs that should probably start thickening up in a few months",

They have some really stylish half frames you might like based on your current pick. \n3. Get the sides cleaned up and part it to the side. It\u2019s a classic look. Play with the length on top at your discretion. Ask your hairdresser to tell you info about the products they chose to style it with, too! If you don\u2019t feel comfortable with salon prices (I sure don\u2019t) just buy cheap drugstore dupes. Consider a shampoo that specifically mentions volumizing on it. Typically you\u2019ll have to buy shampoo marketed towards females and smells like flowers and that\u2019s okay. \n4. Cetaphil face wash and Cetaphil lotion! My nose has the same dryness around it like that.\n5. Embrace your pallor! Tanning is costly and damaging to your skin. \n\nBonus 6. Well-fitting, fresh clothing makes all the difference! If you look at people that tend to be super stylish and conventionally attractive, they\u2019re oftentimes wearing simple t-shirts and jeans, but well-fitting. Not too baggy, not too tight. Look at the size guides for brands and measure yourself. Keep it you. I like muted colors and navy tends to look awesome with your skin tone.\n\nJust have fun and don\u2019t take it all too seriously. Enjoy yourself. :)",
