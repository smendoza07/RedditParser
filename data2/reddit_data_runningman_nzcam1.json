Even during the periods where Running Man was at its lowest I feel at least Kwangsoo was able to bring in laughter and there has never been a time during his 11 years where his presence isn't felt. Like Jaesuk said, just saying \"you worked hard\" to him is nowhere near enough to describe how much work this guy has put into the show. He deserves all the praise and love he has received thus far. Damn I'm tearing up just writing this\ud83d\ude22",
