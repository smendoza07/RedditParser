I feel like this is the same for most fan groups\u2014 so I\u2019m not sharing any big secrets that someone might get upset with me about. ;)\n\nWe have a leader/organizer for the group who collects donations from any of us who want to contribute and then she gives us options based on how much is contributed. She emails and coordinates with the agency to get a date. Apparently it was a little more casual in the past, but at least with Starship, you\u2019re assigned a date. \n\nIn this instance, we collected enough to provide drinks and snacks for about 150 people. This was a pretty simple one (we had one snack- muffins), so I imagine the ones sent the day before were a little more expensive because they provided multiple food options. \nAnyways\u2026 if I remember correctly this one was around $600 USD total. We provided a drink and snack to about 150 people,  which would come to $4 a person. \n\nI like participating because you can always tell from the videos Somin & her stylists share after receiving the trucks that she\u2019s touched by the support and it seems to brighten her day. She\u2019s had so much hate from people over the past few years that it\u2019s worth it to help with the projects when I can. \nI also hope it\u2019s a nice treat for all of the staff on set who are working hard too.",
