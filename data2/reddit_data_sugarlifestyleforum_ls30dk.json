    "body": "So I find myself in the very lucky position where I have 3 SDs \n\n* SD 1 is my long term 2 year full time SR, we see each other every week (when not in strict UK lockdown) and have seen each other through everything from job losses to parental deaths, he's my best friend as well as my SR. \n* SDs 2 and 3 I see only once per month, PPM and have been in my life for around 6 months.\n\nAll 3 are very attentive, generous and up until this week we've had no balancing issues..until now. \n\nSaturday is my birthday and all 3 of them wanted to see me this week, initially I was overjoyed, I mean what girl doesn't want 3 times the cake!  I clearly didn't think  things through and booked 3 dates in a row, SD 2 on Tuesday, SD1 on Wednesday and SD 3 today...and now as I sit on a train speeding towards date 3, I am utterly kanckered and have serious cake belly..\n\nOn Tuesday SD2 planned a day of fun at his flat..mimosa breakfast, a load of warm cookies from his local bakery and then ordered my favourite pizza in evening. I waddled home!   \nNot to mention the hours upon hours of intimacy, which was wonderful but left me utterly exhausted.  \nYesterday SD1 booked us a day room in a London hotel I love, he ordered a huge room service breakfast ( I thought I was going to die) and surprised me with a birthday cake for lunch..by 5pm I was convinced my stomach was going to explode and my blood type is now 99% pure sugar.  \nAlso another day of intimacy when your feeling incredibly stuffed is always a risk, there were times when I thought ''I might crush this man'' \n\nSo today is date 3..he's already sent me a picture of a of a bakery box he's brought ( I might be sick) and has asked me to guess what's inside ( please Jesus be fruit!!)  \nI fear my lady parts may go on strike when faced with another day long intimate date, I've promised them a long soak in the bath later.. \n\nMoral of the story..there is such a thing as too much cake!!   \nSend thoughts and prayers I don't vomit on this poor man and I promise to the sugar Gods I will never be a greedy SB again!",
