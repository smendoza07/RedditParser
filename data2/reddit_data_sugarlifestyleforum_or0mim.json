    "body": "Me (M53) and her (F27) live, play, and travel together and I take care of all her wants and needs. She has her own room, friends, and her own life. Honestly I would be jealous if she was straight and had a boyfriend but I don\u2019t mind the fact that she has a girlfriend in another state. I fly her to see her girlfriend a for week every month and it works out really well because it\u2019s good for us to have a time apart too. Her sexual preference doesn\u2019t stop her from being fantastic at straight sex. I love her but not in a romantic way and I know she loves me too. We are really lucky to have found each other.\nEDIT: She is a lesbian but she has straight sex with me. Some of the comments talk about attraction and being lesbian she obviously isn\u2019t attracted to me but she isn\u2019t revolted by me either.  Ponder this: I\u2019m 53. Fit in trim but still 53. She\u2019s 27. Even if she was straight would she be attracted to me? I think as a straight 27-year-old her attraction to me Would be at about the same level as It is now with her being a lesbian. Something to think about.",

One of my best friends, is a self described lesbian that I met 12+ years ago.  She will only have a romantic relationship with a woman, but we've had a great friendship where I have \"scratched the itch\" when she needs it.  \n\nI'm not really the jealous type anymore, but I could have some jealousy for another man.  Strangely, I've never felt threatened by a woman liking another woman.  I've always felt we each scratch a different itch.  Strangely, I've found some of their lesbian partners are extremely jealous, but that may because they are usually young.",

We are punished if we are not straight, on p much every level of existence. \u201cHeterophobia\u201d as a level of oppression does not exist. Telling someone they\u2019re not straight doesn\u2019t contribute to oppression against straight people. However, telling a lesbian she\u2019s not a lesbian is part of a greater oppressive narrative. No such pressure exists to identify as a lesbian. People who identify as straight even though they are attracted to their own gender or more than one gender, there\u2019s a *worth* there, of safety and protection. That is why the closet exists. That is why comphet exists. There is nothing to be gained from a woman denying attraction to men and saying she\u2019s only attracted to women, especially not safety.\n\n2. But fine. Even though we live in a world where compulsory and assumed heterosexuality is a thing, even in this scenario, *responding by assuming good faith and respecting their autonomy about what they call themselves* is still the correct course of action! Some guys actually do that. Some are in denial about their attraction to men, and some do it for pay (like porn, or sex work), and some do it because there aren\u2019t any other genders around. And the helpful response isn\u2019t \u201cyou\u2019re not straight\u201d *unless they specifically come to you in good confidence to ask your input*. I have a couple friends like this, and not only do I not tell them they\u2019re not straight (unless, again, they ask me about queerness or the community, and even then I say \u201canyone who experiences attraction like this is welcome\u201d, not \u201cyou\u2019re not what you say you are\u201d, because again, the latter is rude and does not respect autonomy), I certainly don\u2019t tell other people they\u2019re not straight. That could actually put them in danger, in addition to being disrespectful of their autonomy. It would be lesbophobic *and* super rude if this OP, knowing his SB is a lesbian, and says she\u2019s a lesbian, came onto this post to say she was bi. This would ignore her autonomy of identification.\n\n3. if you would like an actual comparable example, what you\u2019re doing would be more akin to if a woman who identified as bi, and said she only experienced attraction to women and only ever wanted to be in a relationship with a woman, said she was bisexual, and other people described her as bisexual, and someone went \u201cuh no she\u2019s a lesbian.\u201d i hope you understand why telling bi people that they\u2019re actually gay would be a problem, and biphobic. if you don\u2019t understand that, even after all of my replies, I don\u2019t think there may be any point in my continuing to explain.\n\ngold star rhetoric is based in judging people off their actions that you observe rather than their self identification and internal experience that resulted in that self identification. respect what people say they are. unless you, specifically, are in a relationship with them, it\u2019s not any of your business anyway. this SB says she\u2019s a lesbian, so she\u2019s a lesbian. stop policing other people\u2019s identities and labels. you don\u2019t get it? that\u2019s fine. that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a lesbian.",

Just because she\u2019s having sex with a girl doesn\u2019t make her bi. So a lesbian having sex with a man for money would still be a lesbian if she\u2019s simply not attracted to the man. Sex can also sell feel good even if not with the gender you like. It can still be stimulating.",

Not my business what she is thinking about while I am giving her oral but when I am done she is plenty wet for the next step. \u201cThe next step\u201c probably isn\u2019t her favorite part of the day but I think that\u2019s often the dynamic in a sugar romance. Think of it this way: assuming that you are an average older man and she is an attractive younger woman, How attracted would she be to you even if she was straight? Attraction is a plus but lack of attraction is a often a dynamic of a sugar relationship. My advice would be go for it. Request intimacy sooner than later and see how it works out. Even though she is a lesbian most likely you\u2019re not the first man she\u2019s been with. She knows what she\u2019s getting into. Another thought: I NEVER request her to perform oral sex on me mostly because I\u2019m just not really into it. I think it would be reasonable for an SB to decline getting head whether they were a lesbian or not, that is a whole Other level of intimacy. Hope this helps",

I'm on 15 years older and not bad looking, so it's kind of a coin flip.  She may turn out to be a rinser for all I know but she's very adorable and I'm enjoying her so far in other ways.",

We are punished if we are not straight, on p much every level of existence. \u201cHeterophobia\u201d as a level of oppression does not exist. Telling someone they\u2019re not straight doesn\u2019t contribute to oppression against straight people. However, telling a lesbian she\u2019s not a lesbian is part of a greater oppressive narrative. No such pressure exists to identify as a lesbian. People who identify as straight even though they are attracted to their own gender or more than one gender, there\u2019s a *worth* there, of safety and protection. That is why the closet exists. That is why comphet exists. There is nothing to be gained from a woman denying attraction to men and saying she\u2019s only attracted to women, especially not safety.\n\n2. But fine. Even though we live in a world where compulsory and assumed heterosexuality is a thing, even in this scenario, *responding by assuming good faith and respecting their autonomy about what they call themselves* is still the correct course of action! Some guys actually do that. Some are in denial about their attraction to men, and some do it for pay (like porn, or sex work), and some do it because there aren\u2019t any other genders around. And the helpful response isn\u2019t \u201cyou\u2019re not straight\u201d *unless they specifically come to you in good confidence to ask your input*. I have a couple friends like this, and not only do I not tell them they\u2019re not straight (unless, again, they ask me about queerness or the community, and even then I say \u201canyone who experiences attraction like this is welcome\u201d, not \u201cyou\u2019re not what you say you are\u201d, because again, the latter is rude and does not respect autonomy), I certainly don\u2019t tell other people they\u2019re not straight. That could actually put them in danger, in addition to being disrespectful of their autonomy. It would be lesbophobic *and* super rude if this OP, knowing his SB is a lesbian, and says she\u2019s a lesbian, came onto this post to say she was bi. This would ignore her autonomy of identification.\n\n3. if you would like an actual comparable example, what you\u2019re doing would be more akin to if a woman who identified as bi, and said she only experienced attraction to women and only ever wanted to be in a relationship with a woman, said she was bisexual, and other people described her as bisexual, and someone went \u201cuh no she\u2019s a lesbian.\u201d i hope you understand why telling bi people that they\u2019re actually gay would be a problem, and biphobic. if you don\u2019t understand that, even after all of my replies, I don\u2019t think there may be any point in my continuing to explain.\n\ngold star rhetoric is based in judging people off their actions that you observe rather than their self identification and internal experience that resulted in that self identification. respect what people say they are. unless you, specifically, are in a relationship with them, it\u2019s not any of your business anyway. this SB says she\u2019s a lesbian, so she\u2019s a lesbian. stop policing other people\u2019s identities and labels. you don\u2019t get it? that\u2019s fine. that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a lesbian.",

Not my business what she is thinking about while I am giving her oral but when I am done she is plenty wet for the next step. \u201cThe next step\u201c probably isn\u2019t her favorite part of the day but I think that\u2019s often the dynamic in a sugar romance. Think of it this way: assuming that you are an average older man and she is an attractive younger woman, How attracted would she be to you even if she was straight? Attraction is a plus but lack of attraction is a often a dynamic of a sugar relationship. My advice would be go for it. Request intimacy sooner than later and see how it works out. Even though she is a lesbian most likely you\u2019re not the first man she\u2019s been with. She knows what she\u2019s getting into. Another thought: I NEVER request her to perform oral sex on me mostly because I\u2019m just not really into it. I think it would be reasonable for an SB to decline getting head whether they were a lesbian or not, that is a whole Other level of intimacy. Hope this helps",

We are punished if we are not straight, on p much every level of existence. \u201cHeterophobia\u201d as a level of oppression does not exist. Telling someone they\u2019re not straight doesn\u2019t contribute to oppression against straight people. However, telling a lesbian she\u2019s not a lesbian is part of a greater oppressive narrative. No such pressure exists to identify as a lesbian. People who identify as straight even though they are attracted to their own gender or more than one gender, there\u2019s a *worth* there, of safety and protection. That is why the closet exists. That is why comphet exists. There is nothing to be gained from a woman denying attraction to men and saying she\u2019s only attracted to women, especially not safety.\n\n2. But fine. Even though we live in a world where compulsory and assumed heterosexuality is a thing, even in this scenario, *responding by assuming good faith and respecting their autonomy about what they call themselves* is still the correct course of action! Some guys actually do that. Some are in denial about their attraction to men, and some do it for pay (like porn, or sex work), and some do it because there aren\u2019t any other genders around. And the helpful response isn\u2019t \u201cyou\u2019re not straight\u201d *unless they specifically come to you in good confidence to ask your input*. I have a couple friends like this, and not only do I not tell them they\u2019re not straight (unless, again, they ask me about queerness or the community, and even then I say \u201canyone who experiences attraction like this is welcome\u201d, not \u201cyou\u2019re not what you say you are\u201d, because again, the latter is rude and does not respect autonomy), I certainly don\u2019t tell other people they\u2019re not straight. That could actually put them in danger, in addition to being disrespectful of their autonomy. It would be lesbophobic *and* super rude if this OP, knowing his SB is a lesbian, and says she\u2019s a lesbian, came onto this post to say she was bi. This would ignore her autonomy of identification.\n\n3. if you would like an actual comparable example, what you\u2019re doing would be more akin to if a woman who identified as bi, and said she only experienced attraction to women and only ever wanted to be in a relationship with a woman, said she was bisexual, and other people described her as bisexual, and someone went \u201cuh no she\u2019s a lesbian.\u201d i hope you understand why telling bi people that they\u2019re actually gay would be a problem, and biphobic. if you don\u2019t understand that, even after all of my replies, I don\u2019t think there may be any point in my continuing to explain.\n\ngold star rhetoric is based in judging people off their actions that you observe rather than their self identification and internal experience that resulted in that self identification. respect what people say they are. unless you, specifically, are in a relationship with them, it\u2019s not any of your business anyway. this SB says she\u2019s a lesbian, so she\u2019s a lesbian. stop policing other people\u2019s identities and labels. you don\u2019t get it? that\u2019s fine. that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a lesbian.",

Maybe that also makes their partner feel at ease? If they saw another woman, jealous feelings may develop.",

We are punished if we are not straight, on p much every level of existence. \u201cHeterophobia\u201d as a level of oppression does not exist. Telling someone they\u2019re not straight doesn\u2019t contribute to oppression against straight people. However, telling a lesbian she\u2019s not a lesbian is part of a greater oppressive narrative. No such pressure exists to identify as a lesbian. People who identify as straight even though they are attracted to their own gender or more than one gender, there\u2019s a *worth* there, of safety and protection. That is why the closet exists. That is why comphet exists. There is nothing to be gained from a woman denying attraction to men and saying she\u2019s only attracted to women, especially not safety.\n\n2. But fine. Even though we live in a world where compulsory and assumed heterosexuality is a thing, even in this scenario, *responding by assuming good faith and respecting their autonomy about what they call themselves* is still the correct course of action! Some guys actually do that. Some are in denial about their attraction to men, and some do it for pay (like porn, or sex work), and some do it because there aren\u2019t any other genders around. And the helpful response isn\u2019t \u201cyou\u2019re not straight\u201d *unless they specifically come to you in good confidence to ask your input*. I have a couple friends like this, and not only do I not tell them they\u2019re not straight (unless, again, they ask me about queerness or the community, and even then I say \u201canyone who experiences attraction like this is welcome\u201d, not \u201cyou\u2019re not what you say you are\u201d, because again, the latter is rude and does not respect autonomy), I certainly don\u2019t tell other people they\u2019re not straight. That could actually put them in danger, in addition to being disrespectful of their autonomy. It would be lesbophobic *and* super rude if this OP, knowing his SB is a lesbian, and says she\u2019s a lesbian, came onto this post to say she was bi. This would ignore her autonomy of identification.\n\n3. if you would like an actual comparable example, what you\u2019re doing would be more akin to if a woman who identified as bi, and said she only experienced attraction to women and only ever wanted to be in a relationship with a woman, said she was bisexual, and other people described her as bisexual, and someone went \u201cuh no she\u2019s a lesbian.\u201d i hope you understand why telling bi people that they\u2019re actually gay would be a problem, and biphobic. if you don\u2019t understand that, even after all of my replies, I don\u2019t think there may be any point in my continuing to explain.\n\ngold star rhetoric is based in judging people off their actions that you observe rather than their self identification and internal experience that resulted in that self identification. respect what people say they are. unless you, specifically, are in a relationship with them, it\u2019s not any of your business anyway. this SB says she\u2019s a lesbian, so she\u2019s a lesbian. stop policing other people\u2019s identities and labels. you don\u2019t get it? that\u2019s fine. that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a lesbian.",

We are punished if we are not straight, on p much every level of existence. \u201cHeterophobia\u201d as a level of oppression does not exist. Telling someone they\u2019re not straight doesn\u2019t contribute to oppression against straight people. However, telling a lesbian she\u2019s not a lesbian is part of a greater oppressive narrative. No such pressure exists to identify as a lesbian. People who identify as straight even though they are attracted to their own gender or more than one gender, there\u2019s a *worth* there, of safety and protection. That is why the closet exists. That is why comphet exists. There is nothing to be gained from a woman denying attraction to men and saying she\u2019s only attracted to women, especially not safety.\n\n2. But fine. Even though we live in a world where compulsory and assumed heterosexuality is a thing, even in this scenario, *responding by assuming good faith and respecting their autonomy about what they call themselves* is still the correct course of action! Some guys actually do that. Some are in denial about their attraction to men, and some do it for pay (like porn, or sex work), and some do it because there aren\u2019t any other genders around. And the helpful response isn\u2019t \u201cyou\u2019re not straight\u201d *unless they specifically come to you in good confidence to ask your input*. I have a couple friends like this, and not only do I not tell them they\u2019re not straight (unless, again, they ask me about queerness or the community, and even then I say \u201canyone who experiences attraction like this is welcome\u201d, not \u201cyou\u2019re not what you say you are\u201d, because again, the latter is rude and does not respect autonomy), I certainly don\u2019t tell other people they\u2019re not straight. That could actually put them in danger, in addition to being disrespectful of their autonomy. It would be lesbophobic *and* super rude if this OP, knowing his SB is a lesbian, and says she\u2019s a lesbian, came onto this post to say she was bi. This would ignore her autonomy of identification.\n\n3. if you would like an actual comparable example, what you\u2019re doing would be more akin to if a woman who identified as bi, and said she only experienced attraction to women and only ever wanted to be in a relationship with a woman, said she was bisexual, and other people described her as bisexual, and someone went \u201cuh no she\u2019s a lesbian.\u201d i hope you understand why telling bi people that they\u2019re actually gay would be a problem, and biphobic. if you don\u2019t understand that, even after all of my replies, I don\u2019t think there may be any point in my continuing to explain.\n\ngold star rhetoric is based in judging people off their actions that you observe rather than their self identification and internal experience that resulted in that self identification. respect what people say they are. unless you, specifically, are in a relationship with them, it\u2019s not any of your business anyway. this SB says she\u2019s a lesbian, so she\u2019s a lesbian. stop policing other people\u2019s identities and labels. you don\u2019t get it? that\u2019s fine. that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a lesbian.",

She could be doing this but she's with him 3 weeks out of 4 and the girlfriend one week out of 4.  That's an awful lot of being with him and a lot less of being with her.  I'm surprised her girlfriend is ok with this.  Seems like a lonely position to be in.",

We are punished if we are not straight, on p much every level of existence. \u201cHeterophobia\u201d as a level of oppression does not exist. Telling someone they\u2019re not straight doesn\u2019t contribute to oppression against straight people. However, telling a lesbian she\u2019s not a lesbian is part of a greater oppressive narrative. No such pressure exists to identify as a lesbian. People who identify as straight even though they are attracted to their own gender or more than one gender, there\u2019s a *worth* there, of safety and protection. That is why the closet exists. That is why comphet exists. There is nothing to be gained from a woman denying attraction to men and saying she\u2019s only attracted to women, especially not safety.\n\n2. But fine. Even though we live in a world where compulsory and assumed heterosexuality is a thing, even in this scenario, *responding by assuming good faith and respecting their autonomy about what they call themselves* is still the correct course of action! Some guys actually do that. Some are in denial about their attraction to men, and some do it for pay (like porn, or sex work), and some do it because there aren\u2019t any other genders around. And the helpful response isn\u2019t \u201cyou\u2019re not straight\u201d *unless they specifically come to you in good confidence to ask your input*. I have a couple friends like this, and not only do I not tell them they\u2019re not straight (unless, again, they ask me about queerness or the community, and even then I say \u201canyone who experiences attraction like this is welcome\u201d, not \u201cyou\u2019re not what you say you are\u201d, because again, the latter is rude and does not respect autonomy), I certainly don\u2019t tell other people they\u2019re not straight. That could actually put them in danger, in addition to being disrespectful of their autonomy. It would be lesbophobic *and* super rude if this OP, knowing his SB is a lesbian, and says she\u2019s a lesbian, came onto this post to say she was bi. This would ignore her autonomy of identification.\n\n3. if you would like an actual comparable example, what you\u2019re doing would be more akin to if a woman who identified as bi, and said she only experienced attraction to women and only ever wanted to be in a relationship with a woman, said she was bisexual, and other people described her as bisexual, and someone went \u201cuh no she\u2019s a lesbian.\u201d i hope you understand why telling bi people that they\u2019re actually gay would be a problem, and biphobic. if you don\u2019t understand that, even after all of my replies, I don\u2019t think there may be any point in my continuing to explain.\n\ngold star rhetoric is based in judging people off their actions that you observe rather than their self identification and internal experience that resulted in that self identification. respect what people say they are. unless you, specifically, are in a relationship with them, it\u2019s not any of your business anyway. this SB says she\u2019s a lesbian, so she\u2019s a lesbian. stop policing other people\u2019s identities and labels. you don\u2019t get it? that\u2019s fine. that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a lesbian.",

That is why comphet exists. There is nothing to be gained from a woman denying attraction to men and saying she\u2019s only attracted to women, especially not safety.\n\n2. But fine. Even though we live in a world where compulsory and assumed heterosexuality is a thing, even in this scenario, *responding by assuming good faith and respecting their autonomy about what they call themselves* is still the correct course of action! Some guys actually do that. Some are in denial about their attraction to men, and some do it for pay (like porn, or sex work), and some do it because there aren\u2019t any other genders around. And the helpful response isn\u2019t \u201cyou\u2019re not straight\u201d *unless they specifically come to you in good confidence to ask your input*. I have a couple friends like this, and not only do I not tell them they\u2019re not straight (unless, again, they ask me about queerness or the community, and even then I say \u201canyone who experiences attraction like this is welcome\u201d, not \u201cyou\u2019re not what you say you are\u201d, because again, the latter is rude and does not respect autonomy), I certainly don\u2019t tell other people they\u2019re not straight. That could actually put them in danger, in addition to being disrespectful of their autonomy. It would be lesbophobic *and* super rude if this OP, knowing his SB is a lesbian, and says she\u2019s a lesbian, came onto this post to say she was bi. This would ignore her autonomy of identification.\n\n3. if you would like an actual comparable example, what you\u2019re doing would be more akin to if a woman who identified as bi, and said she only experienced attraction to women and only ever wanted to be in a relationship with a woman, said she was bisexual, and other people described her as bisexual, and someone went \u201cuh no she\u2019s a lesbian.\u201d i hope you understand why telling bi people that they\u2019re actually gay would be a problem, and biphobic. if you don\u2019t understand that, even after all of my replies, I don\u2019t think there may be any point in my continuing to explain.\n\ngold star rhetoric is based in judging people off their actions that you observe rather than their self identification and internal experience that resulted in that self identification. respect what people say they are. unless you, specifically, are in a relationship with them, it\u2019s not any of your business anyway. this SB says she\u2019s a lesbian, so she\u2019s a lesbian. stop policing other people\u2019s identities and labels. you don\u2019t get it? that\u2019s fine. that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a lesbian.",

It leaves the question can you be married and bi without having sex with others?  It all depends on time.",

We are punished if we are not straight, on p much every level of existence. \u201cHeterophobia\u201d as a level of oppression does not exist. Telling someone they\u2019re not straight doesn\u2019t contribute to oppression against straight people. However, telling a lesbian she\u2019s not a lesbian is part of a greater oppressive narrative. No such pressure exists to identify as a lesbian. People who identify as straight even though they are attracted to their own gender or more than one gender, there\u2019s a *worth* there, of safety and protection. That is why the closet exists. That is why comphet exists. There is nothing to be gained from a woman denying attraction to men and saying she\u2019s only attracted to women, especially not safety.\n\n2. But fine. Even though we live in a world where compulsory and assumed heterosexuality is a thing, even in this scenario, *responding by assuming good faith and respecting their autonomy about what they call themselves* is still the correct course of action! Some guys actually do that. Some are in denial about their attraction to men, and some do it for pay (like porn, or sex work), and some do it because there aren\u2019t any other genders around. And the helpful response isn\u2019t \u201cyou\u2019re not straight\u201d *unless they specifically come to you in good confidence to ask your input*. I have a couple friends like this, and not only do I not tell them they\u2019re not straight (unless, again, they ask me about queerness or the community, and even then I say \u201canyone who experiences attraction like this is welcome\u201d, not \u201cyou\u2019re not what you say you are\u201d, because again, the latter is rude and does not respect autonomy), I certainly don\u2019t tell other people they\u2019re not straight. That could actually put them in danger, in addition to being disrespectful of their autonomy. It would be lesbophobic *and* super rude if this OP, knowing his SB is a lesbian, and says she\u2019s a lesbian, came onto this post to say she was bi. This would ignore her autonomy of identification.\n\n3. if you would like an actual comparable example, what you\u2019re doing would be more akin to if a woman who identified as bi, and said she only experienced attraction to women and only ever wanted to be in a relationship with a woman, said she was bisexual, and other people described her as bisexual, and someone went \u201cuh no she\u2019s a lesbian.\u201d i hope you understand why telling bi people that they\u2019re actually gay would be a problem, and biphobic. if you don\u2019t understand that, even after all of my replies, I don\u2019t think there may be any point in my continuing to explain.\n\ngold star rhetoric is based in judging people off their actions that you observe rather than their self identification and internal experience that resulted in that self identification. respect what people say they are. unless you, specifically, are in a relationship with them, it\u2019s not any of your business anyway. this SB says she\u2019s a lesbian, so she\u2019s a lesbian. stop policing other people\u2019s identities and labels. you don\u2019t get it? that\u2019s fine. that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a lesbian.",

We are punished if we are not straight, on p much every level of existence. \u201cHeterophobia\u201d as a level of oppression does not exist. Telling someone they\u2019re not straight doesn\u2019t contribute to oppression against straight people. However, telling a lesbian she\u2019s not a lesbian is part of a greater oppressive narrative. No such pressure exists to identify as a lesbian. People who identify as straight even though they are attracted to their own gender or more than one gender, there\u2019s a *worth* there, of safety and protection. That is why the closet exists. That is why comphet exists. There is nothing to be gained from a woman denying attraction to men and saying she\u2019s only attracted to women, especially not safety.\n\n2. But fine. Even though we live in a world where compulsory and assumed heterosexuality is a thing, even in this scenario, *responding by assuming good faith and respecting their autonomy about what they call themselves* is still the correct course of action! Some guys actually do that. Some are in denial about their attraction to men, and some do it for pay (like porn, or sex work), and some do it because there aren\u2019t any other genders around. And the helpful response isn\u2019t \u201cyou\u2019re not straight\u201d *unless they specifically come to you in good confidence to ask your input*. I have a couple friends like this, and not only do I not tell them they\u2019re not straight (unless, again, they ask me about queerness or the community, and even then I say \u201canyone who experiences attraction like this is welcome\u201d, not \u201cyou\u2019re not what you say you are\u201d, because again, the latter is rude and does not respect autonomy), I certainly don\u2019t tell other people they\u2019re not straight. That could actually put them in danger, in addition to being disrespectful of their autonomy. It would be lesbophobic *and* super rude if this OP, knowing his SB is a lesbian, and says she\u2019s a lesbian, came onto this post to say she was bi. This would ignore her autonomy of identification.\n\n3. if you would like an actual comparable example, what you\u2019re doing would be more akin to if a woman who identified as bi, and said she only experienced attraction to women and only ever wanted to be in a relationship with a woman, said she was bisexual, and other people described her as bisexual, and someone went \u201cuh no she\u2019s a lesbian.\u201d i hope you understand why telling bi people that they\u2019re actually gay would be a problem, and biphobic. if you don\u2019t understand that, even after all of my replies, I don\u2019t think there may be any point in my continuing to explain.\n\ngold star rhetoric is based in judging people off their actions that you observe rather than their self identification and internal experience that resulted in that self identification. respect what people say they are. unless you, specifically, are in a relationship with them, it\u2019s not any of your business anyway. this SB says she\u2019s a lesbian, so she\u2019s a lesbian. stop policing other people\u2019s identities and labels. you don\u2019t get it? that\u2019s fine. that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a lesbian.",

Some guys actually do that. Some are in denial about their attraction to men, and some do it for pay (like porn, or sex work), and some do it because there aren\u2019t any other genders around. And the helpful response isn\u2019t \u201cyou\u2019re not straight\u201d *unless they specifically come to you in good confidence to ask your input*. I have a couple friends like this, and not only do I not tell them they\u2019re not straight (unless, again, they ask me about queerness or the community, and even then I say \u201canyone who experiences attraction like this is welcome\u201d, not \u201cyou\u2019re not what you say you are\u201d, because again, the latter is rude and does not respect autonomy), I certainly don\u2019t tell other people they\u2019re not straight. That could actually put them in danger, in addition to being disrespectful of their autonomy. It would be lesbophobic *and* super rude if this OP, knowing his SB is a lesbian, and says she\u2019s a lesbian, came onto this post to say she was bi. This would ignore her autonomy of identification.\n\n3. if you would like an actual comparable example, what you\u2019re doing would be more akin to if a woman who identified as bi, and said she only experienced attraction to women and only ever wanted to be in a relationship with a woman, said she was bisexual, and other people described her as bisexual, and someone went \u201cuh no she\u2019s a lesbian.\u201d i hope you understand why telling bi people that they\u2019re actually gay would be a problem, and biphobic. if you don\u2019t understand that, even after all of my replies, I don\u2019t think there may be any point in my continuing to explain.\n\ngold star rhetoric is based in judging people off their actions that you observe rather than their self identification and internal experience that resulted in that self identification. respect what people say they are. unless you, specifically, are in a relationship with them, it\u2019s not any of your business anyway. this SB says she\u2019s a lesbian, so she\u2019s a lesbian. stop policing other people\u2019s identities and labels. you don\u2019t get it? that\u2019s fine. that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a lesbian.",
