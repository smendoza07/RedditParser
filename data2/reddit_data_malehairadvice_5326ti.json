I start with damp hair (typically towel dried) and put a small amount of light hold pomade in my palm. Heat it up by rubbing my hands together and then spreading it thoroughly throughout my hair. From there I comb it the general direction I want it to lag and then blow dry that pattern. Once I've done that the shape is pretty well complete. Then I finish the job with layrite cement to hold it all in place! I use mainly because I like the look of the cement, but I like to be able to run my fingers through it pretty often.\nHope that helps!",

Heat it up by rubbing my hands together and then spreading it thoroughly throughout my hair. From there I comb it the general direction I want it to lag and then blow dry that pattern. Once I've done that the shape is pretty well complete. Then I finish the job with layrite cement to hold it all in place! I use mainly because I like the look of the cement, but I like to be able to run my fingers through it pretty often.\nHope that helps!",

It should help a lot.\n\nI just have a similar hair style and thickness and this is the knowledge I've found recently to really bring my style to the next level.\n\nAlso for me, I've been using Original by BluMaan as I felt the same way that American Crew Fiber wasn't cutting it for me either.",
