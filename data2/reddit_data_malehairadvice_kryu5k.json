            "body": "I\u2019m not an expert by any means, but over the last year I\u2019ve discovered that my hair is actually wavy/curly, not straight. Here\u2019s my recommendation:\n\nWhen you get out of the shower, lightly towel-dry your hair with a microfiber towel. Your hair should still be damp, but not dripping. Add a good hair gel using \u201cpraying hands\u201d (I\u2019d recommend a curling gel like AG Re-Coil).\n\nNow the fun part, hang your head upside-down and using a hair dryer with a diffuser (low speed, and hot heat) diffuse your hair. Basically, using the diffuser, slowly push sections of your hair back up towards your head. Depending on the thickness of your hair (and temp of your dryer) you\u2019ll need to hold it for several seconds. \n\nRepeat until you\u2019ve covered all sections of your head. You\u2019ll probably need to go over some sections multiple times (you\u2019re trying to dry your hair, not burn it).\n\nOnce your hair is dry, gently \u201csquish\u201d sections of your hair with a soft t-shirt, until most of the \u201ccrunch\u201d is out of your hair. You should be left with something close to that image. If you\u2019re serious about getting some wave/curl I\u2019d definitely suggest checking out the [curlygirl](http://www.Reddit.com/r/curlygirl) sub.",

Only some oils, sometimes sea salt spray, sometimes this hair tamer i apply to toweled dried hair. \n\nI wash my hair everynight with cold water and try to use water-soluable products. Even if I didn't do much product that day. I make sure to wash through the scalp too. Not crazy big-brother nuggie myself. More like a firm massage. i make sure to wash it off. I don't use a lot of product either. \n\nAlso, not using shampoo means not all of the grease/oils is removed. Which means your hair feels less straight and airy and has a little more weight and textured. This is why I don't use shampoo.\n\nIf hair smelly, I use shampoo.
