    "body": "March 13th 2020 is a day I will always remember.\n\nWhen the world went to hell and I suddenly found myself isolated from my loved ones, a woman came into my life unexpectedly. \n\nThat single message she sent to me here turned out to be a life changing moment because that woman is now a huge part of my life.\n\nShe reached out to a complete stranger out of the kindness of her heart, offering to be a text buddy not knowing who I was, how I looked like or where I was located.\n\nAnd it seems the universe played a part to bring these two individuals together who would go on to help each other in their lives and coincidentally live only 40 min away in the same state.\n\nI often get teary eyed when I think of this day and how this woman has changed my life for the better. For she was there for me when I was all alone and when I didn\u2019t even know I needed her.\n\nShe is sweet and funny and smart. Her heart is beautiful and kind. She always strives for the better of the world in her own little ways. And she is tall, strong and incredibly beautiful.\n\nOne year ago, she was there for me. And one year later, she and her family are going through a difficult time. And I can only hope I can be there for her as a pillar of strength as she was for me a year ago.\n\nYou are the best thing to happen to me. I\u2019m here for you whenever you need me. Always. \u2764\ufe0f",
