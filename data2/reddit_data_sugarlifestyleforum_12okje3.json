    "body": "Context: I left a deeply unhealthy marriage a month ago. I was always exhausted and becoming physically ill over the stress of it. My SD of nearly a year let me move in with him while I figure my life out. \n\nObviously dating financially secure older men has financial perks, but lately I\u2019m finding myself appreciating the stability and calm it offers a young woman. \n\nYes we go on lovely dates and he spoils me, but today, spending the whole afternoon in the garden, chatting, and drinking sparkling wine while sanding/painting his deck chairs I felt more peace than I have in years. \n\nIt\u2019s just such a breath of fresh air to be in a connection where the whole goal is doing nice things for each other",

So many times in my life I\u2019ve bent over backwards for others in my life. Because I am naturally a giver. & they all shit on me in return. I get treated so poorly. So I turned to sugaring as a way to be able to love & give to others while protecting my own heart & making sure I would receive the same respect & appreciation back. I have in a sense replaced most friends with SD\u2019s & started spending my time as I would with \u201cfriends\u201d with my SD\u2019s. Because I\u2019m so tired of shitty people but I like time away to decompress to. Having SD\u2019s allows me as a married woman to do that. Have a great time. Decompress. No drama ever. & I get appreciated for my efforts as well. My husband knows of my relationships. I think he also enjoys me not having a bunch of regular girlfriends cause I don\u2019t have drama either to bring home or being left to question where I stand in groups or with other people. I have a very wonderful peaceful drama free life because of this",

So many times in my life I\u2019ve bent over backwards for others in my life. Because I am naturally a giver. & they all shit on me in return. I get treated so poorly. So I turned to sugaring as a way to be able to love & give to others while protecting my own heart & making sure I would receive the same respect & appreciation back. I have in a sense replaced most friends with SD\u2019s & started spending my time as I would with \u201cfriends\u201d with my SD\u2019s. Because I\u2019m so tired of shitty people but I like time away to decompress to. Having SD\u2019s allows me as a married woman to do that. Have a great time. Decompress. No drama ever. & I get appreciated for my efforts as well. My husband knows of my relationships. I think he also enjoys me not having a bunch of regular girlfriends cause I don\u2019t have drama either to bring home or being left to question where I stand in groups or with other people. I have a very wonderful peaceful drama free life because of this",
