Like I bet he knew he didn't want to end the series without 8 gates guy. But then he also didn't want to end it without six paths Naruto and Sasuke. So he sacrificed a potential kamikaze esc fight for guy because the only person left to fight was Madara. It's a shame really cause as much as I love his fight against Madara it just sort of feels like he's buying time and not a genuine battle",

You can bring up how it\u2019s still the branch house serving the main house but in this situation, clan standing/politics stops being a factor when the situation they faced was full on war between the Leaf and Cloud. Hiashi killed the cloud ninja and so he needed to be killed off to prevent a war, he never wanted his brother to die for his (albeit justified) action. \n\nBut yeah war arc is a mess",
