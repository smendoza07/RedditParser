    "body": "So I\u2019m genuinely curious. \n\nMore than a few times, I\u2019ve started to chat with a guy on SA. Conversation is flowing and we seem to want the same thing. Then all of a sudden, he\u2019ll say \u201cwell I do love to takes girls to concerts and pick up the tab for our dates, but I will never pay someone for their company\u201d. WHICH WOULD BE TOTALLY FINE ON ANY OTHER WEBSITE. However, these dudes are paying $90 per month on SA to essentially find a vanilla girlfriend. What\u2019s the appeal in this?",

Giving someone an allowance/PPM does nothing *for me* in and of itself. Its something for the SB in the relationship that I can provide and I'm happy to provide it. In most cases I'd be equally or more happy to vanilla date the girl (goes without saying) but I understand that isn't what most on SA are looking for. I'm ready and willing and expect to provide an allowance/PPM. Is it not fair to ask \"what do you want out of the relationship?\" in the form of financial support? The answers varies the same way people are looking for different frequency of dates or levels of emotional connection. As an SD I do kind of need to know what you're looking for.",

It would be better for an SD to say \"I'm open to anything from a vanilla relationship to direct financial support depending on what you are looking for and the connection when we meet. What are you looking for?\" and also fair for an SB to say to the intimacy question \"I'm open to anything from platonic friendship to a romantic relationship depending on what you are looking for and the connection when we meet. What are you looking for?\" \n\nThe difference is the money is a one way street. It needs to be figured out ahead of time. Sometimes, that means the onus is on the SB to ask for what she wants, if the SD is open to different types of things. The intimacy and romantic/emotional connection *should* be a two way street and you can let that play itself out naturally once you both confirm you are open and interested in an intimate relationship. I don't want a laundry list of what my SB is comfortable doing sexually before a first date, that would be weird, all I want to know is whether she is open to and looking for a full relationship.",

She told me this weeks after our first intimate date.

At least, that's the vibe I got from her and I'm sure there were plenty of others like that. To get this \"deal\" it probably helps to be under 40 though.",

I was interested in one guy recently who approached me offering an allowance with out a given ammount. We talked and he was kinda cool but in person he was boring and intamate time was lousy the only thing that I was willing to do was sugar date him and his allowance ended up being horribly low so I ended it",

What are you looking for?\" and also fair for an SB to say to the intimacy question \"I'm open to anything from platonic friendship to a romantic relationship depending on what you are looking for and the connection when we meet. What are you looking for?\" \n\nThe difference is the money is a one way street. It needs to be figured out ahead of time. Sometimes, that means the onus is on the SB to ask for what she wants, if the SD is open to different types of things. The intimacy and romantic/emotional connection *should* be a two way street and you can let that play itself out naturally once you both confirm you are open and interested in an intimate relationship. I don't want a laundry list of what my SB is comfortable doing sexually before a first date, that would be weird, all I want to know is whether she is open to and looking for a full relationship.",

At least, that's the vibe I got from her and I'm sure there were plenty of others like that. To get this \"deal\" it probably helps to be under 40 though.",

Sometimes, that means the onus is on the SB to ask for what she wants, if the SD is open to different types of things. The intimacy and romantic/emotional connection *should* be a two way street and you can let that play itself out naturally once you both confirm you are open and interested in an intimate relationship. I don't want a laundry list of what my SB is comfortable doing sexually before a first date, that would be weird, all I want to know is whether she is open to and looking for a full relationship.",

I was interested in one guy recently who approached me offering an allowance with out a given ammount. We talked and he was kinda cool but in person he was boring and intamate time was lousy the only thing that I was willing to do was sugar date him and his allowance ended up being horribly low so I ended it",

What are you looking for?\" and also fair for an SB to say to the intimacy question \"I'm open to anything from platonic friendship to a romantic relationship depending on what you are looking for and the connection when we meet. What are you looking for?\" \n\nThe difference is the money is a one way street. It needs to be figured out ahead of time. Sometimes, that means the onus is on the SB to ask for what she wants, if the SD is open to different types of things. The intimacy and romantic/emotional connection *should* be a two way street and you can let that play itself out naturally once you both confirm you are open and interested in an intimate relationship. I don't want a laundry list of what my SB is comfortable doing sexually before a first date, that would be weird, all I want to know is whether she is open to and looking for a full relationship.",

It's definitely not a large percentage.. probably 5% at most, but you will come across it, and if you're the type of SD that doesnt talk arrangement details until after meeting, you just might meet someone that isnt looking an actual arrangement or allowance.
