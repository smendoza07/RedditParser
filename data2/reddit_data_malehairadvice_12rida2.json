If you don't get to express yourself the way you want it, you're not gonna be enjoying it as much. Sure, maybe if you get a certain hairstyle that's correct for your headshape etc etc you would look better to the world, but if you wanna buzz your hair and would feel happier with that, do that. Take what looks good societally into account, but don't have it override your happiness and what YOU want. At the end of the day, you'll be the only one in that coffin",

If you don't get to express yourself the way you want it, you're not gonna be enjoying it as much.

            "body": "\"In large part\" vs \"all that matters\". If you don't get to express yourself the way you want it, you're not gonna be enjoying it as much. Sure, maybe if you get a certain hairstyle that's correct for your headshape etc etc you would look better to the world, but if you wanna buzz your hair and would feel happier with that, do that. Take what looks good societally into account, but don't have it override your happiness and what YOU want. At the end of the day, you'll be the only one in that coffin",
