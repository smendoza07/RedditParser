We all know that studios and tv shows only care about their bottoms line and will do what\u2019s best for the network without much regard to the talent.  We had a pretty good example of that with the treatment so SJH and Kjk - the fans were the one that had backlash so the producers had to peddle back. As much as we all love them like friends and family, it\u2019s still a business so I imagine you are spot on.",

We all know that studios and tv shows only care about their bottoms line and will do what\u2019s best for the network without much regard to the talent.  We had a pretty good example of that with the treatment so SJH and Kjk - the fans were the one that had backlash so the producers had to peddle back. As much as we all love them like friends and family, it\u2019s still a business so I imagine you are spot on.",
