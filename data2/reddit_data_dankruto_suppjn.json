I don't think there's as much \"talking=free action\" in Naruto (I might be wrong though) than in DB(Z) or Jojo, but the point is, regardless of those \"free actions\", there's no reason for Obito to attempt to convince her in the first place since she has no reason to hesitate and has much more experience under her belt to wrap this up than, again, Rin, and made herself clear about her lack of concern about Obito, who triggered the whole chain of events leading to this war, including declaring it to basically \"Ninja NATO/UN\", which she's already aware of by this point.\n\nIt's less about how fast it happened, but more about \"why are we even talking?\". She made a fool of herself by hesitating for so long against someone she has ALL the reasons to harm, he ended up asking for it. \n\nThere probably would have been much less noise about it if Zetsu regained enough control to hold the incoming kunai or stall long enough, and by the time she tries again, get interrupted by Madara.

Turn out he's secretly suicidal (orphan or not, it's really cheap, it obviously shaped him, but it was an unnecessary conclusion).\n\nMaking a character fail or get foiled while still looking competent isn't even hard, but it's pretty clear Kishimoto didn't think things through considering all the pieces were there for Sakura to \"bag and drag\" (more like \"drag and drop\") this task like a pro, but I'll give that to you, he (almost(?)) always goes for the unnecessary drama when it comes to her decision making in critical moments.",

Naruto and Sasuke basically have it by default. An exhausted Naruto who just had most his chakra absorbed literally punched Sasuke so hard that he flew like 50ft in the air and left a crater in the mountain\n\nHer character is important to the plot as a whole and she gets plenty of screen time.

And the sad part of it is Sakura is one of the better written female characters in Naruto. The bar just is that low and it\u2019s true for most Shonen manga of the era. It\u2019s a valid criticism, but it\u2019s a criticism of the Naruto series as a whole not just a specific character. \n\nSome of you bring up FMAB, the key difference between FMAB and other Shonen manga of the time is that it was written by a woman. It\u2019s only recently that female characters in Shonen manga have started to get better writing",

Winry from FMAB is an incredibly well written character. Denji from CSM had 2 different love interests and >!Aki!< had one of their own in a span of 97 chapters and all 3 of those love interests were well written.

The only thing you can say about Hinata and Naruto's relationship is their is not enough romance for your liking, not bad romance, her fight against Neji or her stepping up to Pain is not bad romance. Sakura's corny lines about her being ready to leave the village for Sasuke is what I would call bad romance, because it was build from a superficial reason like his looks, not a good enough reason to leave your parents over a boy for something like that. That's like saying Dark is a bad show for not having enough romance or Berserk is bad because of less comedy, when other web series or Seinen have them. Something being in less amount doesn't equates it to being \"bad\" or poorly written when it is barely written by the writer in the first place.",

                                            "body": "It's frustrating. I actually enjoy Sakura's character, and while the writing is bad, the actual concept and reasoning behind her is decent. A lot of people cite the \"I love you Naruto\" line as something \"Made my blood boil\". Have these people never socialized before? Or been teenagers? \n\nWhat she did was wrong, but she didn't lie. She did love Naruto in a platonic sense, and she loved him enough to try and stop him from pursuing Sasuke for good. Given that she was told by Sai that Naruto was doing all of this for her, a lie to save him from the chase was a perfectly understandable thing for a teenager to do.\n\nShippuden did a great job of showing how close the 2 of them got. I think she genuinely would've ended up with Naruto if fans weren't so blatantly hateful towards her, which wouldn't have changed the trajectory of her character post-Sasori fight. Up until the end of the Pain arc, she's super close with Naruto, despite not having a lot of panel/screen time. Training with him and Kakashi, trying to calm him down in nine-tails mode, screaming for him to save Konoha because she trusts he's the only one who could, and then reuniting with him after Nagato's death and how she embraces him. Sakura loved Naruto, but the \"fan\" toxicity and Studio Pierrot really fucked us over on ever giving her the chance to grow.\n\nOne more thing before I go, in regards of people saying \"she lied to Naruto and still couldn't kill Sasuke. She's useless blah blah blah\", Sakura and Naruto were very similar in that they wanted to be the best. Sakura believed Naruto and Sasuke were amazing, and wanted to \"catch up\". She recognized both for their ability, and that's why she went so hard with her medical training. An ability that she was naturally good at, and could help the team after her failings earlier in the series. She didn't have dreams of being Hokage, but she believed Naruto or Sasuke could be one day, and wanted to be able to support them. When she goes to kill Sasuke, she isn't acting on her own anymore, and is listening to everyone else around her. Unlike Naruto, who has a childlike innocence to him that refuses to bend, Sakura is more realistic. If Sasuke were dead, things WOULD be better, but when she comes to the actual act of doing it, she can't. It wasn't a decision she made, it was a decision she had forced upon her by everyone else. I think that scene gets a lot of unnecessary hate, and I agree that they should've made Sakura's \"betrayal\" a bit better. Hindsight is 20/20, but having her about to stab Sasuke from behind, hesitating enough for him to notice, and then a Susano rib blocking her kunai would've been a way better rewrite that would've gone a long way towards her character rather than not getting the chance to show that while her heart isn't in the act, her brain knows its for the best.\n\nAlso, Sakura is a big reason why Naruto is even alive by the end of Shippuden, and why they have a chance to win. Medical ninja aren't that flashy, and even Kabuto had to completely abandon his medical background to become relevant, but Sakura is by far the best kunoichi in Naruto. Though a close second and third goes to Tsunade and Shizune imo.",

Look at the recent Star Wars trilogy for a very high profile franchise that was dictated by fan backlash. Sakura was setting up to be Naruto's love interest, and would've shown her \"growth\" by gravitating towards Naruto over Sasuke by the end. Instead, by the end of the Pain arc, Kishi had heard the hate post-Sasori (look at how different her character is from the start of Shippuden to a few episodes after Sasori's fight. Kishi was trying to make her a stronger character and presence in the show, but continued hate ended up sidelining her and reverting her back to what she was before). \n\n>and thought naruto would be stupid enough to fall for that\n\nAs a 15 year old being told by an Anbu Spec Ops shinobi that Naruto was doing all of the Sasuke stuff for her, it's not that weird to think that he was still \"in love\" with her from part 1. Let's not forget that Naruto also claimed to love Sakura before, but was only in it because of his competition with Sasuke. He didn't actually love her either, but his was out of rivalry, whereas hers was hoping that he would believe her half truth. I've seen a few translations of the scene, and can't remember the official wording, but \"I love you\" and \"I'm in love with you\" are 2 very similar yet different things. She loved Naruto, and he loved her, but they weren't \"in love\" with each other at this point. Either way, it was bad writing on Kishi's part by making Sakura's entire personality post Sasori about \"love\". She only has one other goal in the show, and thats: \n\n>I need to catch up to naruto and sasuke\n\nBeing the weakest in the squad, despite being the smartest in the tests, and with the best chakra control of the other 2 would definitely be disheartening. Not to mention that Kakashi does basically nothing for her, and she only undergoes any growth with Tsunade as her teacher. And being 16/17 by the end of the series, it makes perfect sense why she wants to prove herself. She didn't \"whine\" about not being as strong, so much as she knew she wasn't. It was her motivator, just like how Naruto was always trying to prove himself to everyone else who doubted him. Sakura was doubted by everyone + she doubted herself way more than Naruto ever did. Being the 3rd \"MC\", and not really being a MC also hurt her development. Kakashi undergoes more growth than Sakura does, which is absolutely insane when you think about that. Kakashi is amazing, and is one of my favorite characters in anime, but dedicating some of his development into Sakura would've gone a long way. Or Kishi actually committing to the Sakura at the start of Shippuden who isn't love locked by Sasuke and is a super capable Shinobi that even Kakashi and Naruto were shocked by. She doesn't get anything new until the 100 healings at the end of the series.\n\nMeanwhile Sasuke gets to show off a bunch of jutsu he learns with Orochimaru, gets the EMS, Naruto gets 50 new rasengans, sage mode, kcm, and then the duo become reincarnations of Indra/Ashura.\n\nHell, Madara shows more new jutsu and he's only in the last arc. It's bizarre how Sakura gets a summoning and 100 healings, and that's it. She's a healer, yes, but she had years to learn one or two long range jutsu. Especially with her incredible chakra control it could've been something awesome.\n\nThat said, when she actually connects with a punch, it's dope. She is strong enough to crack Susano ribs if Tsunade is anything to go off of, and I wish we could've seen that when she \"distracts\" Madara before being stabbed. Having him pop a partial Susano and underestimating her, just for her to break through and him having to dodge before stabbing her would've been an awesome moment that would've ended up the same. It also would've made her catching Kaguya feel less shoehorned in at the end.",

She wasn't saying that she loved him in a platonic way because that would mean absolutely nothing in the story. That wouldn't have stopped him. Sakura was willing to go back to the village with Naruto and try to forget about Sasuke. That is bad on both sides, and neither of them would have ended up happy. Stop defending this point because there is no good side to it. It doesn't matter that they're 15, it doesn't matter that there's platonic love, what she did was horrible. I think I've argued with you about this before because this sounds like the same argument I had with someone on here.\n\nSo let me ask you this. Put yourself in Naruto's shoes. How would you feel if a close friend suddenly said they like you after years of claiming to love someone else? Would you just blindly accept that? What if you did and the whole thing turned out to be a sham? How would that make you feel? Would you think that false relationship would have been worth it?\n\nTake just a few minutes to think about what would happen if Naruto said yes and the show just stopped there. I'm not talking about Sasuke or the war or anything other than Naruto and Sakura in a relationship. Do you honestly think that would have worked with her \"confession\" being the catalyst. It's obvious that you've never been emotionally manipulated, because if you have, you would never defend what she did.",

Would you think that false relationship would have been worth it?\n\nI have been told that someone close liked me because she didn't like me having eyes for anyone else, and I called them on it, despite liking them as well once upon a time. I have had a relationship FUCKING END because someone's jealousy towards her friend/my girlfriend was used to break us up. Naruto did the right thing for calling her on it, which isn't the argument. But you know what wasn't a factor in it? The jealous \"friend\" wasn't trying to stop me from dating a person who has been labeled as a terrorist and had the opportunity to murder me, only being pulled back by another terrorist who experimented on human children. \n\nBut do you know what it did? It made me rethink whether the relationship was worth it. Naruto never saw accepted that Sasuke was a psychopath, whereas Sakura did. \n\n>Take just a few minutes to think about what would happen if Naruto said yes and the show just stopped there. I'm not talking about Sasuke or the war or anything other than Naruto and Sakura in a relationship. Do you honestly think that would have worked with her \"confession\" being the catalyst. \n\nThe show wouldn't end based off a relationship. If we are talking he never ends up with Hinata, and she never ends up with Sasuke, they'd probably still end up happy. Until the writing makes him call her on it, she could have been 100% truthful. She wouldn't be \"lying to herself\". Would Kishi have said that she was lying if he had believed her? The two of them had many moments throughout Shippuden that showed that they would've worked together, much better than the ones they ended up with. They would've been fine, and Boruto might have never happened as Neji wouldn't have to die for Hinata and Naruto, and Sakura x Naruto would've had a different kid, more in line with Sarada since Sakura is much more hands on in parenting than Hinata seems to be. \n\n\n>It's obvious that you've never been emotionally manipulated, because if you have, you would never defend what she did.\n\nLOL yes, I've never been emotionally manipulated. That isn't what happened when I was 17 with an overjealous \"friend\" and \"best friend\" to my then girlfriend.\n\nYou clearly don't understand the process of writing. Would she have been lying if he didn't call her on it? If anything, he'd be just as bad, as he was only interested in Sakura because he was jealous of Sakura and wanted what she had. Which he grows out of in Shippuden, but they had connected in multiple ways, where she completely trusts Naruto, and Naruto completely trusts basically everyone, so no issue there.",

Saskue yes or sure. Not a Sakura figure. Sakura never gave anything to Naruto. She never helped him grow. Saskue did and others like Kakashi and support characters. I'm not even sure why Sakura was a main character because she never gave anything to Naruto as a character. Or even Sasuke. \n\n>Sasuke even says that he refused to kill Naruto because he wouldn't get stronger the way Itachi expected him to. \n\n\nWhere? He would have gotten the manegko sharingan that way sooner.. Saskue said he went with Orochimaru to get stronger and that he was done playing games with the Konah students. So what do you mean he wouldn't? Itcahci told him to kill Naruto his best friend. He said kill your best friend. He lifted him up with one hand and tried pushing the chidori into his chest. After the fight was over he changed his mind because he saw how far Naruto went for him. \n\nYou trying to spin the narrative to it\nWon't work to awkken his mangeyo sharingan it just weird man. Also it inaccurate because that's how you awkken it. Killing someone or watching someone you love. \n\n>Same with Naruto and Hinata. It was completely one sided.\n\nNo they both talked in school, chuni exams, post kiba fight, Shippuden intro and in between missions to name a few. Naruto was not dismissive of her at all and always responded to her. Saskue never wanted to be around Sakura. Sasuke loved Naruto more in fact. Sasuke supported Naruto as a rival and friend. Not Sakura. There was no exchange of love there. \n\nIf you don't like Hinata it's fine. She's an secondary character we like but why even bother compare her to Sakura if she's suppose to be a main character? \n\nLol it's funny because the only persons who did talk to Sakura was Tsunade and Kakashi. And mostly Kakashi because the Tsunade thing was only in training. But no one reached out to her lol\n\nNaruto had everyone from main character like Gara and secondary characters like Hinata to support him.",

Any of his friends being killed in front of him would've set it off. It could've been Sakura, Shikamaru, Choji, Kiba, etc., but Kishi chose Hinata because he knew the fans wanted them together, and it was the basic pairing everyone assumed from day 1.

Want to go off and overreact to that as well, despite me simply stating facts without putting an emotional response into my answer?\n\nYou need to fucking relax and not take things so personally when you have no idea what you're talking about.",

Sakura might be the only one who knew Hinata loved Naruto a lot and yet she tried to confess to Naruto.\n\n>And fillers can\u2019t show any emotional progression of the character\n\nwhat does that mean here?\n\nThey made fun of it bcz they showed her saying Naruto-kun. In manga she literally teamed up with Naruto when they were searching for Sasuke and she didnt uttered Naruto-kun even once there. They also made fun of her by showing her fainting, the thing is both these things are filler. And u have to be out of your mind if u think thats the only thing to her character. What happened to her being the only kunoichi from Konoha 12 to have a good backstory? What happened to her hardworking to change herself? What happened to her being the only kunoichi from K12 to have an actual goal and dream as to why she became a kunoichi? What happened to the fact that she was changing the Hyuga clan with Neji and proving both branches are equal? Naruto is a huge part of her life and the reason why she started changing, just so u know. People who say her entire character is only Naruto are either haters or didnt get her character. And she never stalked him canonically, its filler and anime made that up.\n\nHe didnt hurt her in 6 tails while hurt Jiraiya in 3 tails, pounced on Kakashi in 2 tails and hurt Sakura in 4 tails, like this there are other examples of him loving her subconsciously. So there are moments and development of their relationship in manga. They even went on many dates (3 of them are officially drawn too).",

She said she started changing after Naruto cheered for her and during her match with Neji said she wont run away anymore. And those changes are visible, she didnt run away from Pain even tho she knew she wont excel. She trained very hard and mastered TLF, was equal to Neji in War Arc and even saved him from a White Zetsu, both her and Neji's Air Palms were equal and so they were able to combine both Air Palms to make Air Wall Palm. She also the only Hyuga to make a variation to 64 palms by combining TLF and 64 palms, even Neji wasnt able to do that.",

Would you call Tobirama a badly-written character because he wasn't fleshed out when he only really featured in the Ten Tails Attack arc and Hashirama's flashbacks?

Plus she became much more badass than she has ever been in recent arcs.\n\nAnd idk man, plenty of people objectify Rocks-era Big Mom lol.",

Most of the characters have a tragic backstory, but they get more development than she does. \n\n> she sacrifices herself to be a way to save her friends.\n\nA sacrifice to save her friends is obviously a noble thing to do and does give her agency, so I don't want to discredit this part of her story. \n\n> she slowly turns ulquiorra from a cold disconnected emotionless person into someone that in the very last moments in his life able to feel and understand the value of the human heart and relationships with others.\n\nThis is obviously a positive thing for her character to do, but once again relegates her to a traditional gender role of existing to further the development of a male character, rather than defining her own character. \n\n> At that time her abilities also go up a notch at least as she is shown being able to now reject things that have been completely destroyed down to being burned to complete ash, which previously she had only ever fixed things on an existing body part.\n\nIt's been a while since I've watched the series, but was *she* doing this with her own powers, or was it *the spirits*? Obviously, she has some power since she can summon them and command them, but it never feels like she's actually doing the work. \n\n> In the final arc she becomes so powerful with her reality rejection powers that she can with some assistance circumvent the power of an omnipotent god and make barriers that even that god cannot break or crack despite his ability to literally consume all of reality if he so chose to. \n\nThis sounds really cool and I'm looking forward to the final arc getting animated finally, so I hope I get to see this. That said, I would again ask if this is power is hers or the power of the spirits she commands. \n\n> Saying all this I wish she had gotten a more directly offensive ability as well like mastering kido \n\nThat sounds wicked cool and I wish that Kubo had done this with her character. It seems fitting for her as an ability she would be able to use and master. \n\nOverall I think she does have more development than I gave her credit for, but nowhere near the development as the male characters. I'm not saying it has to be exactly even for male and female characters, but there's a pretty big disparity in the number, power, and development of male vs. female characters (which, again, is symptomatic of a systemic issue in Japanese culture, not just Bleach).",

It\u2019s specific to humans\n\nSo it is directly her power.  I know that\u2019s confusing because her hair pin bits definitely have their own personality so it appears more like she is summoning others to do it for her but it is directly her power.\n\nFrom beginning of the manga till the end she goes from a shy quirky damaged girl who hides her pain behind a cheery voice and lots of smiles to someone who refuses to lose anyone else in her life and heals and helps friend and foe alike. And believes in herself and her friends to the point of being able to reject god himself\n\nShe learns through her intense experiences and the intense people in her life good or bad that hiding your emotions behind either fake happiness or indifference or just coldness to the world is a weakness that puts irreparable rifts between people that in the end could have related to each other.  You could see this with ulquiorra and herself and with shunsui and stark or ichigo and aizen \n\nA lot of the characters in bleach gain more power and more self confidence (which belief in yourself and your abilities and your friends effects characters strengths hugely in bleach) from facing their feelings and emotions and learning to express them.\n\nBut all of this development like I said isn\u2019t spoon fed to you like a lot of mangas like to do.  \n\nI\u2019d say she could have gotten more development yes but that\u2019s a bit specific to her and not to all the women in bleach.  Lots of the other women in bleach are powerful and deep and have a lot going on with them.  \n\nI\u2019d chalk this up to Kubos biggest problem is not that he is a bad writer but that he is a great writer that has a hard time showing you what he is doing when it is subtle.  It takes a few rereads through to pick up all this stuff and so bleach on the scale of anime and manga suffers because most aren\u2019t willing to put in the time to actually pick up all the details on what he is doing and how well laid out his stories are.  \n\nIf everyone took the time to really read deeply into what they saw in bleach I feel a lot more people would have it in their top ten of all time",

I'd say this for both Bleach and most other manga. I know that the market is aimed at young men, but that doesn't mean there needs to be such a disparity between the genders. \n\nTo be fair to Japan, women have historically been underrepresented and used as props for male development in most western media too. It's only within the last few decades that western media has improved in terms of representation and breaking traditional gender roles. \n\nI know we got off a tangent on Bleach, but it holds true for Naruto too. And don't get me wrong, I love Naruto (and Bleach), but we can still point out the faults in the things we love (and some might say we should criticize media that we love because we want it to be better).",

This is like saying an author is sexist because the male characters in a yuri romance took a backseat.\n\nThe genre is aimed and targeted at boys so naturally the girls would take a back seat in such circumstances. It may be lazy writing but the author isnt sexist for it. It is easier to not develop a character and focus on others than tell your story while giving more background characters development.\n \nFFS. Its barely even lazy\n\n**Most of all shounen manga is done on a weekly/Bi weekly schedule someone is already over worked and rushed on and that includes things like art and story**\n\nMost redditors and mods barely work at all. People like OP and their shitty false sense of activism usually dont do anything significant. I would Love to see OP write and draw story on a weekly basis so we can see how well they write characters.\n\nwhat an grossly asinine thing to even suggest. \n\nLack of effort or detail doesnt equal Sexism FFS.\n\nThis is like calling female designs sexist. Go visit a majority of women artists and their OC. The characters are dressed almost simlarly. League if Legends has a very big player base and a vast majority are women\n Guess what character designs they love? Look up Yakuza or Senren Kagura gmes on twitch. Majority of players are women. \n\n**People like OP speaking about sexism dont even know how it works or why its a thing. People like OP think any female character or woman caus8ngnsome form.of attraction or dependence is a sign of sexism. OP is a fool.**\n\nOP is poisoned by social media activism and is an embaressment.",

Though in the manga she's much more developed as a character. Unfortunately the director of the anime was an Ichiruki shipper so in the anime, some parts important to Orihime's character development were cut from the anime entirely or swapped around and sometimes give to Rukia.\n\n>The other female characters were far better, namely Rukia.\n\nDon't get me wrong she's a pretty cool character with her Bankai having a really cool design as well.",

Demon Slayer was created by a woman and has crappy representation of women imo, and Attack on Titan did great til the last chapter.",

And even then, most of them tend to work for / with a male \u201cmain\u201d character (Riza, Winry). Major General Armstrong is better. \n\nLove demon slayer and AOT but definitely agree.

In a real high school, there will be dudes motivated entirely by their desire for women, and there will be dudes who are creepy to women. The issue comes in that the rest of the characters and the story itself seemingly do not take real issue with this behavior. I don't demand stories shy away from depictions of sexual harassment or assault, but MHA and the aforementioned Dragon Ball have a serious problem by treating it as a harmless joke, which it definitely isn't. \n\nI seem to remember someone telling me that in the manga, he changes somehow, but I'm an anime-only viewer so I don't know any of that for sure. In any case, him having a character arc demanding improvement from him with only sympathy towards the people he was creepy towards would require heavy lifting on the part of the writing, both to sell it as an honest change and to acknowledge that the story itself definitely screwed up in the chapters beforehand. I imagine that, at best, they just sweep the rest of it under the rug. That's not satisfying, but whatever, I'll take it.",

She saw Naruto as an inspiration since he also was seen as a failure, but he never gave up. She admired him for that and that admiration turned into love.\n\nKushina: Brought to Konoha to be the next Jinchuuriki of the Nine Tails. She was bullied for her hot temper and red hair and because she had a special chakra, another village tried to kidnap her. While she was being taken away, her classmate Minato saved her and years later, they got married. She and Minato sacrificed themselves to protect Naruto and Konoha.\n\nTsunade: Trained by Hiruzen Sarutobi, she lost her brother right after his 12th birthday. This and the many deaths in the war made her push for medical advancements in Konoha and the creation of medical squads. She met her boyfriend in the war, which she lost, too. Such trauma gave her hemophobia, which she would overcome in the Battle of the Sannin.\n\nSakura: Other kids bullied her because she had a big forehead, which made her very self-conscious of it. Ino was her first friend and raised her self-esteem, but like Ino, Sakura started to like Sasuke so she antagonized Ino from that day onward.\n\nI know it's easier to say that every female character is badly written, but come on! Is that *really* the case here?",

We barely see sakura or kakashi train. Sasuke and naruto are the reincarnations of sage of 6 path\u2019s children. We are constantly shown naruto and sauske\u2019s growth through out the story more or less around the same time. We never see much of sakura playing an important role. Even kakashi is only needed to play the mentor And nothing more. Infact we get more elaborate back story for sasuke and naruto. While we barely know anything about sakura. Atleast we know kakashi\u2019s life. \nAt no point in the show have they shown sakura and kakashi to be main characters. They are supporting characters and nothing more.  Even towards the end after kaguya is beaten. We see a fight between naruto and sasuke. Sakura and kakashi are not important in that fight. I dont know abt you but to me it feels like sasuke and naruto are the main characters of the show. If i anything its naruto alone who is main protogonist and sasuke plays a deutergonist role. He is more important that supporting character but he isnt necessarily the main character. Whether sasuke was gonna survive or not , we know that naruto was meant to become hokage.",

They both had good screen time and character development in the past, but we haven't seen anything very useful out of them since. Oda has shown us that they both have cool abilities and unique personalities, but when things get serious you don't see them anymore, and all focus is shifted to Luffy, Zoro, and/or Sanji.\n\nAlthough to be fair, Usopp and Chopper are just as bad, if not worse, and it's been a while since I've seen Franky do something cool.",

That being said, I still think they don't have the development they could have. For example, in Wano we saw Robin do some cool espionage stuff when she was taking the blueprints, but haven't seen much else from her. As you said, she is a high priority target for the world government, but from what we see of her, she doesn't seem useful at all, and that's disappointing because she is a very important character being the one who can actually read the road poneglyphs.\n\nI'm not trying to say all the characters need to be in super difficult fights in order to be good characters, but with how slow One Piece is, it would be nice to see my favorite characters actually contribute something here and there. Usopp had an awesome scene in Dressrosa but hasn't done too much else, Nami took Zeus from Big Mom in Whole Cake but that didn't last incredibly long.",

(as a female) Yeah, some aren't exquisite or dont have much of a backstory, but their purpose of living isn't because of a man. Other characters like Komugi, Alluka, and Bisky are good examples of female characters. Some might argue about Komugi and Alluka, but Komugi is a genius, and has dedicated her life to gungi for her family (or something like that), Meruem had much influence of her, but Meruem wasn't her entire backstory. Alluka strives to be herself, even with Nanika trapped inside her, she views it as a part of herself. And Killua accepts her for who she is, but that doesn't mean that her entire personality is based off of a guy. Especially since it's her brother, of course they love each other, but y'know, not the sweet home Alabama type of thing. Heck, even the Phantom Troupe girls are decent. I wouldn't give Togashi an award for this because I think some could be written better and there aren't many females in this show, but it's better than a decent amount of Naruto's female characters. And I haven't watched Shippuden yet, but Sakura and Hinata just don't have great writing. Also, why does shikamaru look so cute?",

Konan exists to support Nagato or Yahiko and their goals. Guren exists to protect a little boy. Chiyo is written as a means to give backstory to Sasori and touch on the themes of generational trauma in war. They all have satisfying changes and growth, but they don't really exist beyond their simple premise. \n\nI think the point they're trying to make is that it's easy to write a character when they only have to exist in a narrow context. It's much harder to write a character like Sakura, who we follow over the course of years and who is meant to be an \"equal\" with the two main characters. I like to believe Kishi would do justice to the characters you mentioned too, but they aren't written to be characters who exist past their given arcs so we will never know.",

In OG Naruto she cheers him before fight with Neji, while Sakura makes fun of him for being an orphan. In Shippuden Hinata risked her life to protect Naruto from Pain and helped him morally recover from Obito's words during war.

Other than saving Kankuro and being a literal puppet for chiyo, she gets in the way or outright causes problems for people up until the war, where she miraculously gets massive power ups and that literally defy logic and plot and becomes outwardly useful.\n\nFor most of the story, Sakura is a net negative in every way. She has amazing moments in the forest of death and in the Sasori fight, and outside of that, she\u2019s just disappointing.\n\nThat\u2019s literally Danzo\u2019s character as well. A manipulator that has great moments, but generally is a hanger on to his teammates and causes more problems than he solves. Difference is Danzo had 52 years of service to the village and had maybe 5 fuck ups that we see, and in 3 years Sakura contributes fuck all.",

We are just suppose to ignore her negatives because we are suppose to like her. \n\nShe\u2019s poorly written because the character she is and how the author portrays her are two totally different concepts.

Like, they don\u2019t have to be the strongest characters to still be good you know? Doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re being sidelined. If they are, then it\u2019s more likely because they\u2019re a side character, or not particularly important to what\u2019s going on, like everyone in Dragon Ball Z besides Goku and Vegeta these days, or they just don\u2019t fight in general, like the girls in Yu Yu Hakusho. It doesn\u2019t make them lesser characters just because they aren\u2019t in the top 20 strongest characters in the series.\n\nLike, I really like Kushina and Hinata (I like all the females in Naruto really). They don\u2019t have to be the strongest ninja around for me to care. They do other stuff and have other struggles besides battles. It\u2019s weird that females get this extra layer of what they need to be good. Like, they can\u2019t be passive or weak, or else they\u2019re bad. Yet people are fine with it if a male is like that. It really feels like like a waste to just ignore everything about a character, all because \u201cthey no fight good\u201d. I really like Keiko from YYH, and nobody really talks about her, yet she has a lot of the qualities people here love to say make Sakura terrible. Keiko is weak (doesn\u2019t even fight), slaps around the main character, needs to be saved more than once, is in love with a male character and that is a big part of what she does in the show, she\u2019s a main character, etc.",

Very few women engage and have engaged in some form of combat. Therefore there's less women in lesser hero roles. Women are not watching combative movies and sports as much as men. This is why women sports is unpopular with lesser views compared to men. \n\nFunny thing about women complaining about women not getting paid as much as men in sport has a lot to do with the demand. Women are not watching it enough to drag in more sponsorship to have them get paid more or as much as men doing the same. What's lacking here? A larger women audience LMAO.

It is for guys, by guys, about guys doing guy shit. Why is it such a sin to have a culture that does not cater to the feminine? I don\u2019t complain about sex and the city not having enough inclusive themes for cis males like action scenes or something stupid. I understand it is a mostly female thing and I let them enjoy it. Don\u2019t come into a space that you understand is dominated by a certain group and demand to change it just cause you kind of like it but it doesn\u2019t exactly cater to your ideals. Go watch something else that does. There\u2019s plenty of other anime that are female friendly.",

My Hero, Chainsaw man, and Jujutsu Kaisen are other very popular shounen that avoid this. In addition, Bleach never really had much in the place of a \"sakura\" either. Rukia had her powers sapped on introduction, and Orahime didn't play an active part in the story until her abduction.\n\nI know I'm kinda going on a tangent here, but Sakura is a very special type of bad, that truly hasn't been in mainstream Shonen",

It's almost impossible to name a female character that is decently present in the series which does not get slapped with the \"angry when mad\" line. Sakura, ino, tsunade, even Naruto's freaking MOM who had so much buildup.  \n\n\nNot to mention, so many of them are healers but healing in the Naruto universe is has such a stupid lack of attention or flair that it feels worthless. The few times Sakura has to perform actual surgical operations and get her hands dirty are what healing jitsu should've been. Instead, we get to see hands glow green for 10 seconds with the only sign of struggle being sweat and silence.   \n\n\nThe worst part is that I can think of super easy ways to make sakura a less flat character without even changing much.   \nFor instance, instead of constantly forcing the idea that Sakura is \"strong in her own way\" like naruto and sasuke, having her acknowledge her weakness and the overwhelming power of her teammates would be way better. For example, Nami and Usopp in One Piece often struggle to come to terms with the mass of talent the other crew members have & it adds an extra layer to their character.",

She made a fool of herself by hesitating for so long against someone she has ALL the reasons to harm, he ended up asking for it. \n\nThere probably would have been much less noise about it if Zetsu regained enough control to hold the incoming kunai or stall long enough, and by the time she tries again, get interrupted by Madara.

Probably because he thought fans will hate her more if he \"shoved\" her down their throats.",

She should be able to punch so hard their great grandmother can feel it. But half the time she ends up being a liability because she's written to be btfo'd before she has the chance to do anything so that another character, usually Naruto, gets the chance to shine by saving her. I don't even remember them showing her knowing a single advanced jutsu other than healing, summoning, and chakra enhanced strength. \n\nHell even her main strength, her chakra enhanced strength, isn't even special by the end of the series. Naruto and Sasuke basically have it by default. An exhausted Naruto who just had most his chakra absorbed literally punched Sasuke so hard that he flew like 50ft in the air and left a crater in the mountain\n\nHer character is important to the plot as a whole and she gets plenty of screen time. But bafflingly little of the plot involvement and screen time was used to develop her in any meaningful way",

The only thing you can say about Hinata and Naruto's relationship is their is not enough romance for your liking, not bad romance, her fight against Neji or her stepping up to Pain is not bad romance. Sakura's corny lines about her being ready to leave the village for Sasuke is what I would call bad romance, because it was build from a superficial reason like his looks, not a good enough reason to leave your parents over a boy for something like that. That's like saying Dark is a bad show for not having enough romance or Berserk is bad because of less comedy, when other web series or Seinen have them. Something being in less amount doesn't equates it to being \"bad\" or poorly written when it is barely written by the writer in the first place.",

                                    "body": "It's frustrating. I actually enjoy Sakura's character, and while the writing is bad, the actual concept and reasoning behind her is decent. A lot of people cite the \"I love you Naruto\" line as something \"Made my blood boil\". Have these people never socialized before? Or been teenagers? \n\nWhat she did was wrong, but she didn't lie. She did love Naruto in a platonic sense, and she loved him enough to try and stop him from pursuing Sasuke for good. Given that she was told by Sai that Naruto was doing all of this for her, a lie to save him from the chase was a perfectly understandable thing for a teenager to do.\n\nShippuden did a great job of showing how close the 2 of them got. I think she genuinely would've ended up with Naruto if fans weren't so blatantly hateful towards her, which wouldn't have changed the trajectory of her character post-Sasori fight. Up until the end of the Pain arc, she's super close with Naruto, despite not having a lot of panel/screen time. Training with him and Kakashi, trying to calm him down in nine-tails mode, screaming for him to save Konoha because she trusts he's the only one who could, and then reuniting with him after Nagato's death and how she embraces him. Sakura loved Naruto, but the \"fan\" toxicity and Studio Pierrot really fucked us over on ever giving her the chance to grow.\n\nOne more thing before I go, in regards of people saying \"she lied to Naruto and still couldn't kill Sasuke. She's useless blah blah blah\", Sakura and Naruto were very similar in that they wanted to be the best. Sakura believed Naruto and Sasuke were amazing, and wanted to \"catch up\". She recognized both for their ability, and that's why she went so hard with her medical training. An ability that she was naturally good at, and could help the team after her failings earlier in the series. She didn't have dreams of being Hokage, but she believed Naruto or Sasuke could be one day, and wanted to be able to support them. When she goes to kill Sasuke, she isn't acting on her own anymore, and is listening to everyone else around her. Unlike Naruto, who has a childlike innocence to him that refuses to bend, Sakura is more realistic. If Sasuke were dead, things WOULD be better, but when she comes to the actual act of doing it, she can't. It wasn't a decision she made, it was a decision she had forced upon her by everyone else. I think that scene gets a lot of unnecessary hate, and I agree that they should've made Sakura's \"betrayal\" a bit better. Hindsight is 20/20, but having her about to stab Sasuke from behind, hesitating enough for him to notice, and then a Susano rib blocking her kunai would've been a way better rewrite that would've gone a long way towards her character rather than not getting the chance to show that while her heart isn't in the act, her brain knows its for the best.\n\nAlso, Sakura is a big reason why Naruto is even alive by the end of Shippuden, and why they have a chance to win. Medical ninja aren't that flashy, and even Kabuto had to completely abandon his medical background to become relevant, but Sakura is by far the best kunoichi in Naruto. Though a close second and third goes to Tsunade and Shizune imo.",

Look at the recent Star Wars trilogy for a very high profile franchise that was dictated by fan backlash. Sakura was setting up to be Naruto's love interest, and would've shown her \"growth\" by gravitating towards Naruto over Sasuke by the end. Instead, by the end of the Pain arc, Kishi had heard the hate post-Sasori (look at how different her character is from the start of Shippuden to a few episodes after Sasori's fight. Kishi was trying to make her a stronger character and presence in the show, but continued hate ended up sidelining her and reverting her back to what she was before). \n\n>and thought naruto would be stupid enough to fall for that\n\nAs a 15 year old being told by an Anbu Spec Ops shinobi that Naruto was doing all of the Sasuke stuff for her, it's not that weird to think that he was still \"in love\" with her from part 1. Let's not forget that Naruto also claimed to love Sakura before, but was only in it because of his competition with Sasuke. He didn't actually love her either, but his was out of rivalry, whereas hers was hoping that he would believe her half truth. I've seen a few translations of the scene, and can't remember the official wording, but \"I love you\" and \"I'm in love with you\" are 2 very similar yet different things. She loved Naruto, and he loved her, but they weren't \"in love\" with each other at this point. Either way, it was bad writing on Kishi's part by making Sakura's entire personality post Sasori about \"love\". She only has one other goal in the show, and thats: \n\n>I need to catch up to naruto and sasuke\n\nBeing the weakest in the squad, despite being the smartest in the tests, and with the best chakra control of the other 2 would definitely be disheartening. Not to mention that Kakashi does basically nothing for her, and she only undergoes any growth with Tsunade as her teacher. And being 16/17 by the end of the series, it makes perfect sense why she wants to prove herself. She didn't \"whine\" about not being as strong, so much as she knew she wasn't. It was her motivator, just like how Naruto was always trying to prove himself to everyone else who doubted him. Sakura was doubted by everyone + she doubted herself way more than Naruto ever did. Being the 3rd \"MC\", and not really being a MC also hurt her development. Kakashi undergoes more growth than Sakura does, which is absolutely insane when you think about that. Kakashi is amazing, and is one of my favorite characters in anime, but dedicating some of his development into Sakura would've gone a long way. Or Kishi actually committing to the Sakura at the start of Shippuden who isn't love locked by Sasuke and is a super capable Shinobi that even Kakashi and Naruto were shocked by. She doesn't get anything new until the 100 healings at the end of the series.\n\nMeanwhile Sasuke gets to show off a bunch of jutsu he learns with Orochimaru, gets the EMS, Naruto gets 50 new rasengans, sage mode, kcm, and then the duo become reincarnations of Indra/Ashura.\n\nHell, Madara shows more new jutsu and he's only in the last arc. It's bizarre how Sakura gets a summoning and 100 healings, and that's it. She's a healer, yes, but she had years to learn one or two long range jutsu. Especially with her incredible chakra control it could've been something awesome.\n\nThat said, when she actually connects with a punch, it's dope. She is strong enough to crack Susano ribs if Tsunade is anything to go off of, and I wish we could've seen that when she \"distracts\" Madara before being stabbed. Having him pop a partial Susano and underestimating her, just for her to break through and him having to dodge before stabbing her would've been an awesome moment that would've ended up the same. It also would've made her catching Kaguya feel less shoehorned in at the end.",

I have had a relationship FUCKING END because someone's jealousy towards her friend/my girlfriend was used to break us up. Naruto did the right thing for calling her on it, which isn't the argument. But you know what wasn't a factor in it? The jealous \"friend\" wasn't trying to stop me from dating a person who has been labeled as a terrorist and had the opportunity to murder me, only being pulled back by another terrorist who experimented on human children. \n\nBut do you know what it did? It made me rethink whether the relationship was worth it. Naruto never saw accepted that Sasuke was a psychopath, whereas Sakura did. \n\n>Take just a few minutes to think about what would happen if Naruto said yes and the show just stopped there. I'm not talking about Sasuke or the war or anything other than Naruto and Sakura in a relationship. Do you honestly think that would have worked with her \"confession\" being the catalyst. \n\nThe show wouldn't end based off a relationship. If we are talking he never ends up with Hinata, and she never ends up with Sasuke, they'd probably still end up happy. Until the writing makes him call her on it, she could have been 100% truthful. She wouldn't be \"lying to herself\". Would Kishi have said that she was lying if he had believed her? The two of them had many moments throughout Shippuden that showed that they would've worked together, much better than the ones they ended up with. They would've been fine, and Boruto might have never happened as Neji wouldn't have to die for Hinata and Naruto, and Sakura x Naruto would've had a different kid, more in line with Sarada since Sakura is much more hands on in parenting than Hinata seems to be. \n\n\n>It's obvious that you've never been emotionally manipulated, because if you have, you would never defend what she did.\n\nLOL yes, I've never been emotionally manipulated. That isn't what happened when I was 17 with an overjealous \"friend\" and \"best friend\" to my then girlfriend.\n\nYou clearly don't understand the process of writing. Would she have been lying if he didn't call her on it? If anything, he'd be just as bad, as he was only interested in Sakura because he was jealous of Sakura and wanted what she had. Which he grows out of in Shippuden, but they had connected in multiple ways, where she completely trusts Naruto, and Naruto completely trusts basically everyone, so no issue there.",

While some scenes could have been written better, deadlines, editor comments, and Kishi admitting he isn't great at female characters is why I can probably write a better Sakura scene, but I wouldn't be able to think up the concepts that Kishi had in the first place, so it's a good thing I wasn't the author. He could've used someone there to help with the side characters though. Most are pretty bad.",

Naruto had been holding back Kurama, and as soon as he saw someone he cared about get murdered in front of him, he snapped.

Saskue yes or sure. Not a Sakura figure. Sakura never gave anything to Naruto. She never helped him grow. Saskue did and others like Kakashi and support characters. I'm not even sure why Sakura was a main character because she never gave anything to Naruto as a character. Or even Sasuke. \n\n>Sasuke even says that he refused to kill Naruto because he wouldn't get stronger the way Itachi expected him to. \n\n\nWhere? He would have gotten the manegko sharingan that way sooner.. Saskue said he went with Orochimaru to get stronger and that he was done playing games with the Konah students. So what do you mean he wouldn't? Itcahci told him to kill Naruto his best friend. He said kill your best friend. He lifted him up with one hand and tried pushing the chidori into his chest. After the fight was over he changed his mind because he saw how far Naruto went for him. \n\nYou trying to spin the narrative to it\nWon't work to awkken his mangeyo sharingan it just weird man. Also it inaccurate because that's how you awkken it. Killing someone or watching someone you love. \n\n>Same with Naruto and Hinata. It was completely one sided.\n\nNo they both talked in school, chuni exams, post kiba fight, Shippuden intro and in between missions to name a few. Naruto was not dismissive of her at all and always responded to her. Saskue never wanted to be around Sakura. Sasuke loved Naruto more in fact. Sasuke supported Naruto as a rival and friend. Not Sakura. There was no exchange of love there. \n\nIf you don't like Hinata it's fine. She's an secondary character we like but why even bother compare her to Sakura if she's suppose to be a main character? \n\nLol it's funny because the only persons who did talk to Sakura was Tsunade and Kakashi. And mostly Kakashi because the Tsunade thing was only in training. But no one reached out to her lol\n\nNaruto had everyone from main character like Gara and secondary characters like Hinata to support him.",

Any of his friends being killed in front of him would've set it off. It could've been Sakura, Shikamaru, Choji, Kiba, etc., but Kishi chose Hinata because he knew the fans wanted them together, and it was the basic pairing everyone assumed from day 1. There was no blood oath involved, and all of his 6 tails was directed at Pain, why would he attack an already dead Hinata? \n\nThey had to make a movie about their story to make it make any sense outside of \"yeah, we shipped them\", and while Naruto never showed any romantic interest back, we need to get them for Boruto\".",

He said he wouldn't rely on Kyubi's powers and gave his words and he never goes back on his words cuz thats his nindo but he broke his nindo for Hinata. Blood Oath from chunin exams bruh. In manga he circled around Hinata's body to attack Pain (why didnt he just went over Hinata's body and instead circled around her?) and when he saw her saying Naruto he got more angry at Pain and then made a Bijudama to launch at Pain.\n\nIts not even true lmao, the movie's production began way before Naruto's ending, thats the reason why u dont see Naruto in his SPSM cloak, Sasuke is seen without his Rinnegan in one of the movie shots and Hinata doesnt use any of her jutsus from War Arc. Movie was already planned. And its the K12 couple which makes the most sense canonically (not including fillers) and Naruto just needed to remember her confession which he forcefully had to forget bcz of Kyubi transformation.",

Sakura might be the only one who knew Hinata loved Naruto a lot and yet she tried to confess to Naruto.\n\n>And fillers can\u2019t show any emotional progression of the character\n\nwhat does that mean here?\n\nThey made fun of it bcz they showed her saying Naruto-kun. In manga she literally teamed up with Naruto when they were searching for Sasuke and she didnt uttered Naruto-kun even once there. They also made fun of her by showing her fainting, the thing is both these things are filler. And u have to be out of your mind if u think thats the only thing to her character. What happened to her being the only kunoichi from Konoha 12 to have a good backstory? What happened to her hardworking to change herself? What happened to her being the only kunoichi from K12 to have an actual goal and dream as to why she became a kunoichi? What happened to the fact that she was changing the Hyuga clan with Neji and proving both branches are equal? Naruto is a huge part of her life and the reason why she started changing, just so u know. People who say her entire character is only Naruto are either haters or didnt get her character. And she never stalked him canonically, its filler and anime made that up.\n\nHe didnt hurt her in 6 tails while hurt Jiraiya in 3 tails, pounced on Kakashi in 2 tails and hurt Sakura in 4 tails, like this there are other examples of him loving her subconsciously. So there are moments and development of their relationship in manga. They even went on many dates (3 of them are officially drawn too).",

And those changes are visible, she didnt run away from Pain even tho she knew she wont excel. She trained very hard and mastered TLF, was equal to Neji in War Arc and even saved him from a White Zetsu, both her and Neji's Air Palms were equal and so they were able to combine both Air Palms to make Air Wall Palm. She also the only Hyuga to make a variation to 64 palms by combining TLF and 64 palms, even Neji wasnt able to do that.",

Most of the characters have a tragic backstory, but they get more development than she does. \n\n> she sacrifices herself to be a way to save her friends.\n\nA sacrifice to save her friends is obviously a noble thing to do and does give her agency, so I don't want to discredit this part of her story. \n\n> she slowly turns ulquiorra from a cold disconnected emotionless person into someone that in the very last moments in his life able to feel and understand the value of the human heart and relationships with others.\n\nThis is obviously a positive thing for her character to do, but once again relegates her to a traditional gender role of existing to further the development of a male character, rather than defining her own character. \n\n> At that time her abilities also go up a notch at least as she is shown being able to now reject things that have been completely destroyed down to being burned to complete ash, which previously she had only ever fixed things on an existing body part.\n\nIt's been a while since I've watched the series, but was *she* doing this with her own powers, or was it *the spirits*? Obviously, she has some power since she can summon them and command them, but it never feels like she's actually doing the work. \n\n> In the final arc she becomes so powerful with her reality rejection powers that she can with some assistance circumvent the power of an omnipotent god and make barriers that even that god cannot break or crack despite his ability to literally consume all of reality if he so chose to. \n\nThis sounds really cool and I'm looking forward to the final arc getting animated finally, so I hope I get to see this. That said, I would again ask if this is power is hers or the power of the spirits she commands. \n\n> Saying all this I wish she had gotten a more directly offensive ability as well like mastering kido \n\nThat sounds wicked cool and I wish that Kubo had done this with her character. It seems fitting for her as an ability she would be able to use and master. \n\nOverall I think she does have more development than I gave her credit for, but nowhere near the development as the male characters. I'm not saying it has to be exactly even for male and female characters, but there's a pretty big disparity in the number, power, and development of male vs. female characters (which, again, is symptomatic of a systemic issue in Japanese culture, not just Bleach).",

I know that\u2019s confusing because her hair pin bits definitely have their own personality so it appears more like she is summoning others to do it for her but it is directly her power.\n\nFrom beginning of the manga till the end she goes from a shy quirky damaged girl who hides her pain behind a cheery voice and lots of smiles to someone who refuses to lose anyone else in her life and heals and helps friend and foe alike. And believes in herself and her friends to the point of being able to reject god himself\n\nShe learns through her intense experiences and the intense people in her life good or bad that hiding your emotions behind either fake happiness or indifference or just coldness to the world is a weakness that puts irreparable rifts between people that in the end could have related to each other.  You could see this with ulquiorra and herself and with shunsui and stark or ichigo and aizen \n\nA lot of the characters in bleach gain more power and more self confidence (which belief in yourself and your abilities and your friends effects characters strengths hugely in bleach) from facing their feelings and emotions and learning to express them.\n\nBut all of this development like I said isn\u2019t spoon fed to you like a lot of mangas like to do.  \n\nI\u2019d say she could have gotten more development yes but that\u2019s a bit specific to her and not to all the women in bleach.  Lots of the other women in bleach are powerful and deep and have a lot going on with them.  \n\nI\u2019d chalk this up to Kubos biggest problem is not that he is a bad writer but that he is a great writer that has a hard time showing you what he is doing when it is subtle.  It takes a few rereads through to pick up all this stuff and so bleach on the scale of anime and manga suffers because most aren\u2019t willing to put in the time to actually pick up all the details on what he is doing and how well laid out his stories are.  \n\nIf everyone took the time to really read deeply into what they saw in bleach I feel a lot more people would have it in their top ten of all time",

I concede that she has more character development than I give her credit for. \n\n> Lots of the other women in bleach are powerful and deep and have a lot going on with them. \n\nDo you feel that the character development of the women is comparable to that of the men in A) Bleach and B) most other manga series? \n\nI'm not saying that the women in manga get *no* development, but I wouldn't say it's comparable to the way the male characters get treated. I'd say this for both Bleach and most other manga. I know that the market is aimed at young men, but that doesn't mean there needs to be such a disparity between the genders. \n\nTo be fair to Japan, women have historically been underrepresented and used as props for male development in most western media too. It's only within the last few decades that western media has improved in terms of representation and breaking traditional gender roles. \n\nI know we got off a tangent on Bleach, but it holds true for Naruto too. And don't get me wrong, I love Naruto (and Bleach), but we can still point out the faults in the things we love (and some might say we should criticize media that we love because we want it to be better).",

This is like saying an author is sexist because the male characters in a yuri romance took a backseat.\n\nThe genre is aimed and targeted at boys so naturally the girls would take a back seat in such circumstances. It may be lazy writing but the author isnt sexist for it. It is easier to not develop a character and focus on others than tell your story while giving more background characters development.\n \nFFS. Its barely even lazy\n\n**Most of all shounen manga is done on a weekly/Bi weekly schedule someone is already over worked and rushed on and that includes things like art and story**\n\nMost redditors and mods barely work at all. People like OP and their shitty false sense of activism usually dont do anything significant. I would Love to see OP write and draw story on a weekly basis so we can see how well they write characters.\n\nwhat an grossly asinine thing to even suggest. \n\nLack of effort or detail doesnt equal Sexism FFS.\n\nThis is like calling female designs sexist. Go visit a majority of women artists and their OC. The characters are dressed almost simlarly. League if Legends has a very big player base and a vast majority are women\n Guess what character designs they love? Look up Yakuza or Senren Kagura gmes on twitch. Majority of players are women. \n\n**People like OP speaking about sexism dont even know how it works or why its a thing. People like OP think any female character or woman caus8ngnsome form.of attraction or dependence is a sign of sexism. OP is a fool.**\n\nOP is poisoned by social media activism and is an embaressment.",

Though in the manga she's much more developed as a character. Unfortunately the director of the anime was an Ichiruki shipper so in the anime, some parts important to Orihime's character development were cut from the anime entirely or swapped around and sometimes give to Rukia.\n\n>The other female characters were far better, namely Rukia.\n\nDon't get me wrong she's a pretty cool character with her Bankai having a really cool design as well.",

In a real high school, there will be dudes motivated entirely by their desire for women, and there will be dudes who are creepy to women. The issue comes in that the rest of the characters and the story itself seemingly do not take real issue with this behavior. I don't demand stories shy away from depictions of sexual harassment or assault, but MHA and the aforementioned Dragon Ball have a serious problem by treating it as a harmless joke, which it definitely isn't. \n\nI seem to remember someone telling me that in the manga, he changes somehow, but I'm an anime-only viewer so I don't know any of that for sure. In any case, him having a character arc demanding improvement from him with only sympathy towards the people he was creepy towards would require heavy lifting on the part of the writing, both to sell it as an honest change and to acknowledge that the story itself definitely screwed up in the chapters beforehand. I imagine that, at best, they just sweep the rest of it under the rug. That's not satisfying, but whatever, I'll take it.",

We are constantly shown naruto and sauske\u2019s growth through out the story more or less around the same time. We never see much of sakura playing an important role. Even kakashi is only needed to play the mentor And nothing more. Infact we get more elaborate back story for sasuke and naruto. While we barely know anything about sakura. Atleast we know kakashi\u2019s life. \nAt no point in the show have they shown sakura and kakashi to be main characters. They are supporting characters and nothing more.  Even towards the end after kaguya is beaten. We see a fight between naruto and sasuke. Sakura and kakashi are not important in that fight. I dont know abt you but to me it feels like sasuke and naruto are the main characters of the show. If i anything its naruto alone who is main protogonist and sasuke plays a deutergonist role. He is more important that supporting character but he isnt necessarily the main character. Whether sasuke was gonna survive or not , we know that naruto was meant to become hokage.",

Konan exists to support Nagato or Yahiko and their goals. Guren exists to protect a little boy. Chiyo is written as a means to give backstory to Sasori and touch on the themes of generational trauma in war. They all have satisfying changes and growth, but they don't really exist beyond their simple premise. \n\nI think the point they're trying to make is that it's easy to write a character when they only have to exist in a narrow context. It's much harder to write a character like Sakura, who we follow over the course of years and who is meant to be an \"equal\" with the two main characters. I like to believe Kishi would do justice to the characters you mentioned too, but they aren't written to be characters who exist past their given arcs so we will never know.",

Other than saving Kankuro and being a literal puppet for chiyo, she gets in the way or outright causes problems for people up until the war, where she miraculously gets massive power ups and that literally defy logic and plot and becomes outwardly useful.\n\nFor most of the story, Sakura is a net negative in every way. She has amazing moments in the forest of death and in the Sasori fight, and outside of that, she\u2019s just disappointing.\n\nThat\u2019s literally Danzo\u2019s character as well. A manipulator that has great moments, but generally is a hanger on to his teammates and causes more problems than he solves. Difference is Danzo had 52 years of service to the village and had maybe 5 fuck ups that we see, and in 3 years Sakura contributes fuck all.",

She made a fool of herself by hesitating for so long against someone she has ALL the reasons to harm, he ended up asking for it. \n\nThere probably would have been much less noise about it if Zetsu regained enough control to hold the incoming kunai or stall long enough, and by the time she tries again, get interrupted by Madara.

She should be able to punch so hard their great grandmother can feel it. But half the time she ends up being a liability because she's written to be btfo'd before she has the chance to do anything so that another character, usually Naruto, gets the chance to shine by saving her. I don't even remember them showing her knowing a single advanced jutsu other than healing, summoning, and chakra enhanced strength. \n\nHell even her main strength, her chakra enhanced strength, isn't even special by the end of the series. Naruto and Sasuke basically have it by default. An exhausted Naruto who just had most his chakra absorbed literally punched Sasuke so hard that he flew like 50ft in the air and left a crater in the mountain\n\nHer character is important to the plot as a whole and she gets plenty of screen time. But bafflingly little of the plot involvement and screen time was used to develop her in any meaningful way",

The only thing you can say about Hinata and Naruto's relationship is their is not enough romance for your liking, not bad romance, her fight against Neji or her stepping up to Pain is not bad romance. Sakura's corny lines about her being ready to leave the village for Sasuke is what I would call bad romance, because it was build from a superficial reason like his looks, not a good enough reason to leave your parents over a boy for something like that. That's like saying Dark is a bad show for not having enough romance or Berserk is bad because of less comedy, when other web series or Seinen have them. Something being in less amount doesn't equates it to being \"bad\" or poorly written when it is barely written by the writer in the first place.",

                            "body": "It's frustrating. I actually enjoy Sakura's character, and while the writing is bad, the actual concept and reasoning behind her is decent. A lot of people cite the \"I love you Naruto\" line as something \"Made my blood boil\". Have these people never socialized before? Or been teenagers? \n\nWhat she did was wrong, but she didn't lie. She did love Naruto in a platonic sense, and she loved him enough to try and stop him from pursuing Sasuke for good. Given that she was told by Sai that Naruto was doing all of this for her, a lie to save him from the chase was a perfectly understandable thing for a teenager to do.\n\nShippuden did a great job of showing how close the 2 of them got. I think she genuinely would've ended up with Naruto if fans weren't so blatantly hateful towards her, which wouldn't have changed the trajectory of her character post-Sasori fight. Up until the end of the Pain arc, she's super close with Naruto, despite not having a lot of panel/screen time. Training with him and Kakashi, trying to calm him down in nine-tails mode, screaming for him to save Konoha because she trusts he's the only one who could, and then reuniting with him after Nagato's death and how she embraces him. Sakura loved Naruto, but the \"fan\" toxicity and Studio Pierrot really fucked us over on ever giving her the chance to grow.\n\nOne more thing before I go, in regards of people saying \"she lied to Naruto and still couldn't kill Sasuke. She's useless blah blah blah\", Sakura and Naruto were very similar in that they wanted to be the best. Sakura believed Naruto and Sasuke were amazing, and wanted to \"catch up\". She recognized both for their ability, and that's why she went so hard with her medical training. An ability that she was naturally good at, and could help the team after her failings earlier in the series. She didn't have dreams of being Hokage, but she believed Naruto or Sasuke could be one day, and wanted to be able to support them. When she goes to kill Sasuke, she isn't acting on her own anymore, and is listening to everyone else around her. Unlike Naruto, who has a childlike innocence to him that refuses to bend, Sakura is more realistic. If Sasuke were dead, things WOULD be better, but when she comes to the actual act of doing it, she can't. It wasn't a decision she made, it was a decision she had forced upon her by everyone else. I think that scene gets a lot of unnecessary hate, and I agree that they should've made Sakura's \"betrayal\" a bit better. Hindsight is 20/20, but having her about to stab Sasuke from behind, hesitating enough for him to notice, and then a Susano rib blocking her kunai would've been a way better rewrite that would've gone a long way towards her character rather than not getting the chance to show that while her heart isn't in the act, her brain knows its for the best.\n\nAlso, Sakura is a big reason why Naruto is even alive by the end of Shippuden, and why they have a chance to win. Medical ninja aren't that flashy, and even Kabuto had to completely abandon his medical background to become relevant, but Sakura is by far the best kunoichi in Naruto. Though a close second and third goes to Tsunade and Shizune imo.",

Look at the recent Star Wars trilogy for a very high profile franchise that was dictated by fan backlash. Sakura was setting up to be Naruto's love interest, and would've shown her \"growth\" by gravitating towards Naruto over Sasuke by the end. Instead, by the end of the Pain arc, Kishi had heard the hate post-Sasori (look at how different her character is from the start of Shippuden to a few episodes after Sasori's fight. Kishi was trying to make her a stronger character and presence in the show, but continued hate ended up sidelining her and reverting her back to what she was before). \n\n>and thought naruto would be stupid enough to fall for that\n\nAs a 15 year old being told by an Anbu Spec Ops shinobi that Naruto was doing all of the Sasuke stuff for her, it's not that weird to think that he was still \"in love\" with her from part 1. Let's not forget that Naruto also claimed to love Sakura before, but was only in it because of his competition with Sasuke. He didn't actually love her either, but his was out of rivalry, whereas hers was hoping that he would believe her half truth. I've seen a few translations of the scene, and can't remember the official wording, but \"I love you\" and \"I'm in love with you\" are 2 very similar yet different things. She loved Naruto, and he loved her, but they weren't \"in love\" with each other at this point. Either way, it was bad writing on Kishi's part by making Sakura's entire personality post Sasori about \"love\". She only has one other goal in the show, and thats: \n\n>I need to catch up to naruto and sasuke\n\nBeing the weakest in the squad, despite being the smartest in the tests, and with the best chakra control of the other 2 would definitely be disheartening. Not to mention that Kakashi does basically nothing for her, and she only undergoes any growth with Tsunade as her teacher. And being 16/17 by the end of the series, it makes perfect sense why she wants to prove herself. She didn't \"whine\" about not being as strong, so much as she knew she wasn't. It was her motivator, just like how Naruto was always trying to prove himself to everyone else who doubted him. Sakura was doubted by everyone + she doubted herself way more than Naruto ever did. Being the 3rd \"MC\", and not really being a MC also hurt her development. Kakashi undergoes more growth than Sakura does, which is absolutely insane when you think about that. Kakashi is amazing, and is one of my favorite characters in anime, but dedicating some of his development into Sakura would've gone a long way. Or Kishi actually committing to the Sakura at the start of Shippuden who isn't love locked by Sasuke and is a super capable Shinobi that even Kakashi and Naruto were shocked by. She doesn't get anything new until the 100 healings at the end of the series.\n\nMeanwhile Sasuke gets to show off a bunch of jutsu he learns with Orochimaru, gets the EMS, Naruto gets 50 new rasengans, sage mode, kcm, and then the duo become reincarnations of Indra/Ashura.\n\nHell, Madara shows more new jutsu and he's only in the last arc. It's bizarre how Sakura gets a summoning and 100 healings, and that's it. She's a healer, yes, but she had years to learn one or two long range jutsu. Especially with her incredible chakra control it could've been something awesome.\n\nThat said, when she actually connects with a punch, it's dope. She is strong enough to crack Susano ribs if Tsunade is anything to go off of, and I wish we could've seen that when she \"distracts\" Madara before being stabbed. Having him pop a partial Susano and underestimating her, just for her to break through and him having to dodge before stabbing her would've been an awesome moment that would've ended up the same. It also would've made her catching Kaguya feel less shoehorned in at the end.",

How would you feel if a close friend suddenly said they like you after years of claiming to love someone else? Would you just blindly accept that? What if you did and the whole thing turned out to be a sham? How would that make you feel? Would you think that false relationship would have been worth it?\n\nI have been told that someone close liked me because she didn't like me having eyes for anyone else, and I called them on it, despite liking them as well once upon a time. I have had a relationship FUCKING END because someone's jealousy towards her friend/my girlfriend was used to break us up. Naruto did the right thing for calling her on it, which isn't the argument. But you know what wasn't a factor in it? The jealous \"friend\" wasn't trying to stop me from dating a person who has been labeled as a terrorist and had the opportunity to murder me, only being pulled back by another terrorist who experimented on human children. \n\nBut do you know what it did? It made me rethink whether the relationship was worth it. Naruto never saw accepted that Sasuke was a psychopath, whereas Sakura did. \n\n>Take just a few minutes to think about what would happen if Naruto said yes and the show just stopped there. I'm not talking about Sasuke or the war or anything other than Naruto and Sakura in a relationship. Do you honestly think that would have worked with her \"confession\" being the catalyst. \n\nThe show wouldn't end based off a relationship. If we are talking he never ends up with Hinata, and she never ends up with Sasuke, they'd probably still end up happy. Until the writing makes him call her on it, she could have been 100% truthful. She wouldn't be \"lying to herself\". Would Kishi have said that she was lying if he had believed her? The two of them had many moments throughout Shippuden that showed that they would've worked together, much better than the ones they ended up with. They would've been fine, and Boruto might have never happened as Neji wouldn't have to die for Hinata and Naruto, and Sakura x Naruto would've had a different kid, more in line with Sarada since Sakura is much more hands on in parenting than Hinata seems to be. \n\n\n>It's obvious that you've never been emotionally manipulated, because if you have, you would never defend what she did.\n\nLOL yes, I've never been emotionally manipulated. That isn't what happened when I was 17 with an overjealous \"friend\" and \"best friend\" to my then girlfriend.\n\nYou clearly don't understand the process of writing. Would she have been lying if he didn't call her on it? If anything, he'd be just as bad, as he was only interested in Sakura because he was jealous of Sakura and wanted what she had. Which he grows out of in Shippuden, but they had connected in multiple ways, where she completely trusts Naruto, and Naruto completely trusts basically everyone, so no issue there.",

Saskue yes or sure. Not a Sakura figure. Sakura never gave anything to Naruto. She never helped him grow. Saskue did and others like Kakashi and support characters. I'm not even sure why Sakura was a main character because she never gave anything to Naruto as a character. Or even Sasuke. \n\n>Sasuke even says that he refused to kill Naruto because he wouldn't get stronger the way Itachi expected him to. \n\n\nWhere? He would have gotten the manegko sharingan that way sooner.. Saskue said he went with Orochimaru to get stronger and that he was done playing games with the Konah students. So what do you mean he wouldn't? Itcahci told him to kill Naruto his best friend. He said kill your best friend. He lifted him up with one hand and tried pushing the chidori into his chest. After the fight was over he changed his mind because he saw how far Naruto went for him. \n\nYou trying to spin the narrative to it\nWon't work to awkken his mangeyo sharingan it just weird man. Also it inaccurate because that's how you awkken it. Killing someone or watching someone you love. \n\n>Same with Naruto and Hinata. It was completely one sided.\n\nNo they both talked in school, chuni exams, post kiba fight, Shippuden intro and in between missions to name a few. Naruto was not dismissive of her at all and always responded to her. Saskue never wanted to be around Sakura. Sasuke loved Naruto more in fact. Sasuke supported Naruto as a rival and friend. Not Sakura. There was no exchange of love there. \n\nIf you don't like Hinata it's fine. She's an secondary character we like but why even bother compare her to Sakura if she's suppose to be a main character? \n\nLol it's funny because the only persons who did talk to Sakura was Tsunade and Kakashi. And mostly Kakashi because the Tsunade thing was only in training. But no one reached out to her lol\n\nNaruto had everyone from main character like Gara and secondary characters like Hinata to support him.",

I know that he spared him because he didn't want to kill his friend and submit to Itachi's will. How about you \"Watch it again on NarutoGet\". Or Netflix, or crunchyroll, or a myriad of other official places that should be readily available.\n\nWhen you realize you're wrong, please don't respond and apologize. You have wasted enough time.",

She's useless. She didn't teach anyone anything to help them be better. She didn't help anyone grow. Not even to the supporting characters. You only see this in Boruto 1 time when she's training with Sasuke's daughter. But that's it. \n\n\n>he didn't want to kill his friend\n\nYeah that's what I said dummy \ud83e\udd23",

Any of his friends being killed in front of him would've set it off. It could've been Sakura, Shikamaru, Choji, Kiba, etc., but Kishi chose Hinata because he knew the fans wanted them together, and it was the basic pairing everyone assumed from day 1. There was no blood oath involved, and all of his 6 tails was directed at Pain, why would he attack an already dead Hinata? \n\nThey had to make a movie about their story to make it make any sense outside of \"yeah, we shipped them\", and while Naruto never showed any romantic interest back, we need to get them for Boruto\".",

He said he wouldn't rely on Kyubi's powers and gave his words and he never goes back on his words cuz thats his nindo but he broke his nindo for Hinata. Blood Oath from chunin exams bruh. In manga he circled around Hinata's body to attack Pain (why didnt he just went over Hinata's body and instead circled around her?) and when he saw her saying Naruto he got more angry at Pain and then made a Bijudama to launch at Pain.\n\nIts not even true lmao, the movie's production began way before Naruto's ending, thats the reason why u dont see Naruto in his SPSM cloak, Sasuke is seen without his Rinnegan in one of the movie shots and Hinata doesnt use any of her jutsus from War Arc. Movie was already planned. And its the K12 couple which makes the most sense canonically (not including fillers) and Naruto just needed to remember her confession which he forcefully had to forget bcz of Kyubi transformation.",

When Kushina hits Naruto in that one movie it\u2019s not abuse. Both acts are fundamentally the same a mother hitting her child, but due to Japanese cultural norms one of them is an actual depiction of abuse while the other is just slap stick humour.

In manga she literally teamed up with Naruto when they were searching for Sasuke and she didnt uttered Naruto-kun even once there. They also made fun of her by showing her fainting, the thing is both these things are filler. And u have to be out of your mind if u think thats the only thing to her character. What happened to her being the only kunoichi from Konoha 12 to have a good backstory? What happened to her hardworking to change herself? What happened to her being the only kunoichi from K12 to have an actual goal and dream as to why she became a kunoichi? What happened to the fact that she was changing the Hyuga clan with Neji and proving both branches are equal? Naruto is a huge part of her life and the reason why she started changing, just so u know. People who say her entire character is only Naruto are either haters or didnt get her character. And she never stalked him canonically, its filler and anime made that up.\n\nHe didnt hurt her in 6 tails while hurt Jiraiya in 3 tails, pounced on Kakashi in 2 tails and hurt Sakura in 4 tails, like this there are other examples of him loving her subconsciously. So there are moments and development of their relationship in manga. They even went on many dates (3 of them are officially drawn too).",

And her changing the hyuga clan with Neji was not in episode 1, it was shown in War Arc. \n\nAnd her development wasnt forgotten. She said she started changing after Naruto cheered for her and during her match with Neji said she wont run away anymore. And those changes are visible, she didnt run away from Pain even tho she knew she wont excel. She trained very hard and mastered TLF, was equal to Neji in War Arc and even saved him from a White Zetsu, both her and Neji's Air Palms were equal and so they were able to combine both Air Palms to make Air Wall Palm. She also the only Hyuga to make a variation to 64 palms by combining TLF and 64 palms, even Neji wasnt able to do that.",

Who she is and how she acts do not change at all throughout the story until the 3rd time Skip. From chapter 1 to chapter 700 she never becomes more than a shy girl who loves Naruto. Like I said there was a lot of potential w her back story and exploring her life in her sisters shadow, but she had so little screen time that it\u2019s never explored or fleshed out. We don\u2019t actually see her training or working hard or changing the hyuga plan. She says that\u2019s what she wants to do and then one day during the war arc we find out she did it",

Most of the characters have a tragic backstory, but they get more development than she does. \n\n> she sacrifices herself to be a way to save her friends.\n\nA sacrifice to save her friends is obviously a noble thing to do and does give her agency, so I don't want to discredit this part of her story. \n\n> she slowly turns ulquiorra from a cold disconnected emotionless person into someone that in the very last moments in his life able to feel and understand the value of the human heart and relationships with others.\n\nThis is obviously a positive thing for her character to do, but once again relegates her to a traditional gender role of existing to further the development of a male character, rather than defining her own character. \n\n> At that time her abilities also go up a notch at least as she is shown being able to now reject things that have been completely destroyed down to being burned to complete ash, which previously she had only ever fixed things on an existing body part.\n\nIt's been a while since I've watched the series, but was *she* doing this with her own powers, or was it *the spirits*? Obviously, she has some power since she can summon them and command them, but it never feels like she's actually doing the work. \n\n> In the final arc she becomes so powerful with her reality rejection powers that she can with some assistance circumvent the power of an omnipotent god and make barriers that even that god cannot break or crack despite his ability to literally consume all of reality if he so chose to. \n\nThis sounds really cool and I'm looking forward to the final arc getting animated finally, so I hope I get to see this. That said, I would again ask if this is power is hers or the power of the spirits she commands. \n\n> Saying all this I wish she had gotten a more directly offensive ability as well like mastering kido \n\nThat sounds wicked cool and I wish that Kubo had done this with her character. It seems fitting for her as an ability she would be able to use and master. \n\nOverall I think she does have more development than I gave her credit for, but nowhere near the development as the male characters. I'm not saying it has to be exactly even for male and female characters, but there's a pretty big disparity in the number, power, and development of male vs. female characters (which, again, is symptomatic of a systemic issue in Japanese culture, not just Bleach).",

It\u2019s specific to humans\n\nSo it is directly her power.  I know that\u2019s confusing because her hair pin bits definitely have their own personality so it appears more like she is summoning others to do it for her but it is directly her power.\n\nFrom beginning of the manga till the end she goes from a shy quirky damaged girl who hides her pain behind a cheery voice and lots of smiles to someone who refuses to lose anyone else in her life and heals and helps friend and foe alike. And believes in herself and her friends to the point of being able to reject god himself\n\nShe learns through her intense experiences and the intense people in her life good or bad that hiding your emotions behind either fake happiness or indifference or just coldness to the world is a weakness that puts irreparable rifts between people that in the end could have related to each other.  You could see this with ulquiorra and herself and with shunsui and stark or ichigo and aizen \n\nA lot of the characters in bleach gain more power and more self confidence (which belief in yourself and your abilities and your friends effects characters strengths hugely in bleach) from facing their feelings and emotions and learning to express them.\n\nBut all of this development like I said isn\u2019t spoon fed to you like a lot of mangas like to do.  \n\nI\u2019d say she could have gotten more development yes but that\u2019s a bit specific to her and not to all the women in bleach.  Lots of the other women in bleach are powerful and deep and have a lot going on with them.  \n\nI\u2019d chalk this up to Kubos biggest problem is not that he is a bad writer but that he is a great writer that has a hard time showing you what he is doing when it is subtle.  It takes a few rereads through to pick up all this stuff and so bleach on the scale of anime and manga suffers because most aren\u2019t willing to put in the time to actually pick up all the details on what he is doing and how well laid out his stories are.  \n\nIf everyone took the time to really read deeply into what they saw in bleach I feel a lot more people would have it in their top ten of all time",

I concede that she has more character development than I give her credit for. \n\n> Lots of the other women in bleach are powerful and deep and have a lot going on with them. \n\nDo you feel that the character development of the women is comparable to that of the men in A) Bleach and B) most other manga series? \n\nI'm not saying that the women in manga get *no* development, but I wouldn't say it's comparable to the way the male characters get treated. I'd say this for both Bleach and most other manga. I know that the market is aimed at young men, but that doesn't mean there needs to be such a disparity between the genders. \n\nTo be fair to Japan, women have historically been underrepresented and used as props for male development in most western media too. It's only within the last few decades that western media has improved in terms of representation and breaking traditional gender roles. \n\nI know we got off a tangent on Bleach, but it holds true for Naruto too. And don't get me wrong, I love Naruto (and Bleach), but we can still point out the faults in the things we love (and some might say we should criticize media that we love because we want it to be better).",

In a real high school, there will be dudes motivated entirely by their desire for women, and there will be dudes who are creepy to women. The issue comes in that the rest of the characters and the story itself seemingly do not take real issue with this behavior. I don't demand stories shy away from depictions of sexual harassment or assault, but MHA and the aforementioned Dragon Ball have a serious problem by treating it as a harmless joke, which it definitely isn't. \n\nI seem to remember someone telling me that in the manga, he changes somehow, but I'm an anime-only viewer so I don't know any of that for sure. In any case, him having a character arc demanding improvement from him with only sympathy towards the people he was creepy towards would require heavy lifting on the part of the writing, both to sell it as an honest change and to acknowledge that the story itself definitely screwed up in the chapters beforehand. I imagine that, at best, they just sweep the rest of it under the rug. That's not satisfying, but whatever, I'll take it.",

Even kakashi is only needed to play the mentor And nothing more. Infact we get more elaborate back story for sasuke and naruto. While we barely know anything about sakura. Atleast we know kakashi\u2019s life. \nAt no point in the show have they shown sakura and kakashi to be main characters. They are supporting characters and nothing more.  Even towards the end after kaguya is beaten. We see a fight between naruto and sasuke. Sakura and kakashi are not important in that fight. I dont know abt you but to me it feels like sasuke and naruto are the main characters of the show. If i anything its naruto alone who is main protogonist and sasuke plays a deutergonist role. He is more important that supporting character but he isnt necessarily the main character. Whether sasuke was gonna survive or not , we know that naruto was meant to become hokage.",

For example, in Wano we saw Robin do some cool espionage stuff when she was taking the blueprints, but haven't seen much else from her. As you said, she is a high priority target for the world government, but from what we see of her, she doesn't seem useful at all, and that's disappointing because she is a very important character being the one who can actually read the road poneglyphs.\n\nI'm not trying to say all the characters need to be in super difficult fights in order to be good characters, but with how slow One Piece is, it would be nice to see my favorite characters actually contribute something here and there. Usopp had an awesome scene in Dressrosa but hasn't done too much else, Nami took Zeus from Big Mom in Whole Cake but that didn't last incredibly long.",

Konan exists to support Nagato or Yahiko and their goals. Guren exists to protect a little boy. Chiyo is written as a means to give backstory to Sasori and touch on the themes of generational trauma in war. They all have satisfying changes and growth, but they don't really exist beyond their simple premise. \n\nI think the point they're trying to make is that it's easy to write a character when they only have to exist in a narrow context. It's much harder to write a character like Sakura, who we follow over the course of years and who is meant to be an \"equal\" with the two main characters. I like to believe Kishi would do justice to the characters you mentioned too, but they aren't written to be characters who exist past their given arcs so we will never know.",

Other than saving Kankuro and being a literal puppet for chiyo, she gets in the way or outright causes problems for people up until the war, where she miraculously gets massive power ups and that literally defy logic and plot and becomes outwardly useful.\n\nFor most of the story, Sakura is a net negative in every way. She has amazing moments in the forest of death and in the Sasori fight, and outside of that, she\u2019s just disappointing.\n\nThat\u2019s literally Danzo\u2019s character as well. A manipulator that has great moments, but generally is a hanger on to his teammates and causes more problems than he solves. Difference is Danzo had 52 years of service to the village and had maybe 5 fuck ups that we see, and in 3 years Sakura contributes fuck all.",

If he only fucked up 5 times, then he was a tremendous asset to the village.

She made a fool of herself by hesitating for so long against someone she has ALL the reasons to harm, he ended up asking for it. \n\nThere probably would have been much less noise about it if Zetsu regained enough control to hold the incoming kunai or stall long enough, and by the time she tries again, get interrupted by Madara.

            "body": "She had a lot of potential for improvement as a character both in terms of character growth and power and it really just fell flat. \n\nShe's supposed to be able to punch so hard she can casually split the ground.  She should be able to punch so hard their great grandmother can feel it. But half the time she ends up being a liability because she's written to be btfo'd before she has the chance to do anything so that another character, usually Naruto, gets the chance to shine by saving her. I don't even remember them showing her knowing a single advanced jutsu other than healing, summoning, and chakra enhanced strength. \n\nHell even her main strength, her chakra enhanced strength, isn't even special by the end of the series. Naruto and Sasuke basically have it by default. An exhausted Naruto who just had most his chakra absorbed literally punched Sasuke so hard that he flew like 50ft in the air and left a crater in the mountain\n\nHer character is important to the plot as a whole and she gets plenty of screen time. But bafflingly little of the plot involvement and screen time was used to develop her in any meaningful way",

The only thing you can say about Hinata and Naruto's relationship is their is not enough romance for your liking, not bad romance, her fight against Neji or her stepping up to Pain is not bad romance. Sakura's corny lines about her being ready to leave the village for Sasuke is what I would call bad romance, because it was build from a superficial reason like his looks, not a good enough reason to leave your parents over a boy for something like that. That's like saying Dark is a bad show for not having enough romance or Berserk is bad because of less comedy, when other web series or Seinen have them. Something being in less amount doesn't equates it to being \"bad\" or poorly written when it is barely written by the writer in the first place.",

                    "body": "It's frustrating. I actually enjoy Sakura's character, and while the writing is bad, the actual concept and reasoning behind her is decent. A lot of people cite the \"I love you Naruto\" line as something \"Made my blood boil\". Have these people never socialized before? Or been teenagers? \n\nWhat she did was wrong, but she didn't lie. She did love Naruto in a platonic sense, and she loved him enough to try and stop him from pursuing Sasuke for good. Given that she was told by Sai that Naruto was doing all of this for her, a lie to save him from the chase was a perfectly understandable thing for a teenager to do.\n\nShippuden did a great job of showing how close the 2 of them got. I think she genuinely would've ended up with Naruto if fans weren't so blatantly hateful towards her, which wouldn't have changed the trajectory of her character post-Sasori fight. Up until the end of the Pain arc, she's super close with Naruto, despite not having a lot of panel/screen time. Training with him and Kakashi, trying to calm him down in nine-tails mode, screaming for him to save Konoha because she trusts he's the only one who could, and then reuniting with him after Nagato's death and how she embraces him. Sakura loved Naruto, but the \"fan\" toxicity and Studio Pierrot really fucked us over on ever giving her the chance to grow.\n\nOne more thing before I go, in regards of people saying \"she lied to Naruto and still couldn't kill Sasuke. She's useless blah blah blah\", Sakura and Naruto were very similar in that they wanted to be the best. Sakura believed Naruto and Sasuke were amazing, and wanted to \"catch up\". She recognized both for their ability, and that's why she went so hard with her medical training. An ability that she was naturally good at, and could help the team after her failings earlier in the series. She didn't have dreams of being Hokage, but she believed Naruto or Sasuke could be one day, and wanted to be able to support them. When she goes to kill Sasuke, she isn't acting on her own anymore, and is listening to everyone else around her. Unlike Naruto, who has a childlike innocence to him that refuses to bend, Sakura is more realistic. If Sasuke were dead, things WOULD be better, but when she comes to the actual act of doing it, she can't. It wasn't a decision she made, it was a decision she had forced upon her by everyone else. I think that scene gets a lot of unnecessary hate, and I agree that they should've made Sakura's \"betrayal\" a bit better. Hindsight is 20/20, but having her about to stab Sasuke from behind, hesitating enough for him to notice, and then a Susano rib blocking her kunai would've been a way better rewrite that would've gone a long way towards her character rather than not getting the chance to show that while her heart isn't in the act, her brain knows its for the best.\n\nAlso, Sakura is a big reason why Naruto is even alive by the end of Shippuden, and why they have a chance to win. Medical ninja aren't that flashy, and even Kabuto had to completely abandon his medical background to become relevant, but Sakura is by far the best kunoichi in Naruto. Though a close second and third goes to Tsunade and Shizune imo.",

Look at the recent Star Wars trilogy for a very high profile franchise that was dictated by fan backlash. Sakura was setting up to be Naruto's love interest, and would've shown her \"growth\" by gravitating towards Naruto over Sasuke by the end. Instead, by the end of the Pain arc, Kishi had heard the hate post-Sasori (look at how different her character is from the start of Shippuden to a few episodes after Sasori's fight. Kishi was trying to make her a stronger character and presence in the show, but continued hate ended up sidelining her and reverting her back to what she was before). \n\n>and thought naruto would be stupid enough to fall for that\n\nAs a 15 year old being told by an Anbu Spec Ops shinobi that Naruto was doing all of the Sasuke stuff for her, it's not that weird to think that he was still \"in love\" with her from part 1. Let's not forget that Naruto also claimed to love Sakura before, but was only in it because of his competition with Sasuke. He didn't actually love her either, but his was out of rivalry, whereas hers was hoping that he would believe her half truth. I've seen a few translations of the scene, and can't remember the official wording, but \"I love you\" and \"I'm in love with you\" are 2 very similar yet different things. She loved Naruto, and he loved her, but they weren't \"in love\" with each other at this point. Either way, it was bad writing on Kishi's part by making Sakura's entire personality post Sasori about \"love\". She only has one other goal in the show, and thats: \n\n>I need to catch up to naruto and sasuke\n\nBeing the weakest in the squad, despite being the smartest in the tests, and with the best chakra control of the other 2 would definitely be disheartening. Not to mention that Kakashi does basically nothing for her, and she only undergoes any growth with Tsunade as her teacher. And being 16/17 by the end of the series, it makes perfect sense why she wants to prove herself. She didn't \"whine\" about not being as strong, so much as she knew she wasn't. It was her motivator, just like how Naruto was always trying to prove himself to everyone else who doubted him. Sakura was doubted by everyone + she doubted herself way more than Naruto ever did. Being the 3rd \"MC\", and not really being a MC also hurt her development. Kakashi undergoes more growth than Sakura does, which is absolutely insane when you think about that. Kakashi is amazing, and is one of my favorite characters in anime, but dedicating some of his development into Sakura would've gone a long way. Or Kishi actually committing to the Sakura at the start of Shippuden who isn't love locked by Sasuke and is a super capable Shinobi that even Kakashi and Naruto were shocked by. She doesn't get anything new until the 100 healings at the end of the series.\n\nMeanwhile Sasuke gets to show off a bunch of jutsu he learns with Orochimaru, gets the EMS, Naruto gets 50 new rasengans, sage mode, kcm, and then the duo become reincarnations of Indra/Ashura.\n\nHell, Madara shows more new jutsu and he's only in the last arc. It's bizarre how Sakura gets a summoning and 100 healings, and that's it. She's a healer, yes, but she had years to learn one or two long range jutsu. Especially with her incredible chakra control it could've been something awesome.\n\nThat said, when she actually connects with a punch, it's dope. She is strong enough to crack Susano ribs if Tsunade is anything to go off of, and I wish we could've seen that when she \"distracts\" Madara before being stabbed. Having him pop a partial Susano and underestimating her, just for her to break through and him having to dodge before stabbing her would've been an awesome moment that would've ended up the same. It also would've made her catching Kaguya feel less shoehorned in at the end.",

She loved Naruto, and he loved her, but they weren't \"in love\" with each other at this point.\n\nRegardless of the official translation, even if she just said \"suki da yo\" or \"daisuki\" or any other word that means like or love in Japanese it doesn't matter. She was framing that as a love confession. She was lying to Naruto to try and stop him. It was 100% emotional manipulation. She wasn't saying that she loved him in a platonic way because that would mean absolutely nothing in the story. That wouldn't have stopped him. Sakura was willing to go back to the village with Naruto and try to forget about Sasuke. That is bad on both sides, and neither of them would have ended up happy. Stop defending this point because there is no good side to it. It doesn't matter that they're 15, it doesn't matter that there's platonic love, what she did was horrible. I think I've argued with you about this before because this sounds like the same argument I had with someone on here.\n\nSo let me ask you this. Put yourself in Naruto's shoes. How would you feel if a close friend suddenly said they like you after years of claiming to love someone else? Would you just blindly accept that? What if you did and the whole thing turned out to be a sham? How would that make you feel? Would you think that false relationship would have been worth it?\n\nTake just a few minutes to think about what would happen if Naruto said yes and the show just stopped there. I'm not talking about Sasuke or the war or anything other than Naruto and Sakura in a relationship. Do you honestly think that would have worked with her \"confession\" being the catalyst. It's obvious that you've never been emotionally manipulated, because if you have, you would never defend what she did.",

I have had a relationship FUCKING END because someone's jealousy towards her friend/my girlfriend was used to break us up. Naruto did the right thing for calling her on it, which isn't the argument. But you know what wasn't a factor in it? The jealous \"friend\" wasn't trying to stop me from dating a person who has been labeled as a terrorist and had the opportunity to murder me, only being pulled back by another terrorist who experimented on human children. \n\nBut do you know what it did? It made me rethink whether the relationship was worth it. Naruto never saw accepted that Sasuke was a psychopath, whereas Sakura did. \n\n>Take just a few minutes to think about what would happen if Naruto said yes and the show just stopped there. I'm not talking about Sasuke or the war or anything other than Naruto and Sakura in a relationship. Do you honestly think that would have worked with her \"confession\" being the catalyst. \n\nThe show wouldn't end based off a relationship. If we are talking he never ends up with Hinata, and she never ends up with Sasuke, they'd probably still end up happy. Until the writing makes him call her on it, she could have been 100% truthful. She wouldn't be \"lying to herself\". Would Kishi have said that she was lying if he had believed her? The two of them had many moments throughout Shippuden that showed that they would've worked together, much better than the ones they ended up with. They would've been fine, and Boruto might have never happened as Neji wouldn't have to die for Hinata and Naruto, and Sakura x Naruto would've had a different kid, more in line with Sarada since Sakura is much more hands on in parenting than Hinata seems to be. \n\n\n>It's obvious that you've never been emotionally manipulated, because if you have, you would never defend what she did.\n\nLOL yes, I've never been emotionally manipulated. That isn't what happened when I was 17 with an overjealous \"friend\" and \"best friend\" to my then girlfriend.\n\nYou clearly don't understand the process of writing. Would she have been lying if he didn't call her on it? If anything, he'd be just as bad, as he was only interested in Sakura because he was jealous of Sakura and wanted what she had. Which he grows out of in Shippuden, but they had connected in multiple ways, where she completely trusts Naruto, and Naruto completely trusts basically everyone, so no issue there.",

                            "body": "> Not JUST because it was Hinata\n\nOf course, I though that was implied. But had he killed Sakura it would have not been the last straw. Saskue yes or sure. Not a Sakura figure. Sakura never gave anything to Naruto. She never helped him grow. Saskue did and others like Kakashi and support characters. I'm not even sure why Sakura was a main character because she never gave anything to Naruto as a character. Or even Sasuke. \n\n>Sasuke even says that he refused to kill Naruto because he wouldn't get stronger the way Itachi expected him to. \n\n\nWhere? He would have gotten the manegko sharingan that way sooner.. Saskue said he went with Orochimaru to get stronger and that he was done playing games with the Konah students. So what do you mean he wouldn't? Itcahci told him to kill Naruto his best friend. He said kill your best friend. He lifted him up with one hand and tried pushing the chidori into his chest. After the fight was over he changed his mind because he saw how far Naruto went for him. \n\nYou trying to spin the narrative to it\nWon't work to awkken his mangeyo sharingan it just weird man. Also it inaccurate because that's how you awkken it. Killing someone or watching someone you love. \n\n>Same with Naruto and Hinata. It was completely one sided.\n\nNo they both talked in school, chuni exams, post kiba fight, Shippuden intro and in between missions to name a few. Naruto was not dismissive of her at all and always responded to her. Saskue never wanted to be around Sakura. Sasuke loved Naruto more in fact. Sasuke supported Naruto as a rival and friend. Not Sakura. There was no exchange of love there. \n\nIf you don't like Hinata it's fine. She's an secondary character we like but why even bother compare her to Sakura if she's suppose to be a main character? \n\nLol it's funny because the only persons who did talk to Sakura was Tsunade and Kakashi. And mostly Kakashi because the Tsunade thing was only in training. But no one reached out to her lol\n\nNaruto had everyone from main character like Gara and secondary characters like Hinata to support him.",

I know that he spared him because he didn't want to kill his friend and submit to Itachi's will. How about you \"Watch it again on NarutoGet\". Or Netflix, or crunchyroll, or a myriad of other official places that should be readily available.\n\nWhen you realize you're wrong, please don't respond and apologize. You have wasted enough time.",

She's useless. She didn't teach anyone anything to help them be better. She didn't help anyone grow. Not even to the supporting characters. You only see this in Boruto 1 time when she's training with Sasuke's daughter. But that's it. \n\n\n>he didn't want to kill his friend\n\nYeah that's what I said dummy \ud83e\udd23",

Any of his friends being killed in front of him would've set it off. It could've been Sakura, Shikamaru, Choji, Kiba, etc., but Kishi chose Hinata because he knew the fans wanted them together, and it was the basic pairing everyone assumed from day 1. There was no blood oath involved, and all of his 6 tails was directed at Pain, why would he attack an already dead Hinata? \n\nThey had to make a movie about their story to make it make any sense outside of \"yeah, we shipped them\", and while Naruto never showed any romantic interest back, we need to get them for Boruto\".",

He said he wouldn't rely on Kyubi's powers and gave his words and he never goes back on his words cuz thats his nindo but he broke his nindo for Hinata. Blood Oath from chunin exams bruh. In manga he circled around Hinata's body to attack Pain (why didnt he just went over Hinata's body and instead circled around her?) and when he saw her saying Naruto he got more angry at Pain and then made a Bijudama to launch at Pain.\n\nIts not even true lmao, the movie's production began way before Naruto's ending, thats the reason why u dont see Naruto in his SPSM cloak, Sasuke is seen without his Rinnegan in one of the movie shots and Hinata doesnt use any of her jutsus from War Arc. Movie was already planned. And its the K12 couple which makes the most sense canonically (not including fillers) and Naruto just needed to remember her confession which he forcefully had to forget bcz of Kyubi transformation.",

When Kushina hits Naruto in that one movie it\u2019s not abuse. Both acts are fundamentally the same a mother hitting her child, but due to Japanese cultural norms one of them is an actual depiction of abuse while the other is just slap stick humour. Naruto is never physically or emotionally traumatized from being hit by Kushina or Sakura",

In manga she literally teamed up with Naruto when they were searching for Sasuke and she didnt uttered Naruto-kun even once there. They also made fun of her by showing her fainting, the thing is both these things are filler. And u have to be out of your mind if u think thats the only thing to her character. What happened to her being the only kunoichi from Konoha 12 to have a good backstory? What happened to her hardworking to change herself? What happened to her being the only kunoichi from K12 to have an actual goal and dream as to why she became a kunoichi? What happened to the fact that she was changing the Hyuga clan with Neji and proving both branches are equal? Naruto is a huge part of her life and the reason why she started changing, just so u know. People who say her entire character is only Naruto are either haters or didnt get her character. And she never stalked him canonically, its filler and anime made that up.\n\nHe didnt hurt her in 6 tails while hurt Jiraiya in 3 tails, pounced on Kakashi in 2 tails and hurt Sakura in 4 tails, like this there are other examples of him loving her subconsciously. So there are moments and development of their relationship in manga. They even went on many dates (3 of them are officially drawn too).",

And those changes are visible, she didnt run away from Pain even tho she knew she wont excel. She trained very hard and mastered TLF, was equal to Neji in War Arc and even saved him from a White Zetsu, both her and Neji's Air Palms were equal and so they were able to combine both Air Palms to make Air Wall Palm.

Who she is and how she acts do not change at all throughout the story until the 3rd time Skip. From chapter 1 to chapter 700 she never becomes more than a shy girl who loves Naruto. Like I said there was a lot of potential w her back story and exploring her life in her sisters shadow, but she had so little screen time that it\u2019s never explored or fleshed out. We don\u2019t actually see her training or working hard or changing the hyuga plan. She says that\u2019s what she wants to do and then one day during the war arc we find out she did it",

She's the most loving female character and also supported her teammates as well. \n\nSakura is a plain bad evil bitch. She even has her Inner Sakura to prove it. That inner demon represent how she really felt. She made fun of Naruto for not having parents right in front of Saskue. Pure evil and selfish to say the least. \n\nPeople aren't hating in a secondary support character like Hinata or Kiba. \n\nPeople don't like Sakura because she's a main character that's useless and evil.

Most of the characters have a tragic backstory, but they get more development than she does. \n\n> she sacrifices herself to be a way to save her friends.\n\nA sacrifice to save her friends is obviously a noble thing to do and does give her agency, so I don't want to discredit this part of her story. \n\n> she slowly turns ulquiorra from a cold disconnected emotionless person into someone that in the very last moments in his life able to feel and understand the value of the human heart and relationships with others.\n\nThis is obviously a positive thing for her character to do, but once again relegates her to a traditional gender role of existing to further the development of a male character, rather than defining her own character. \n\n> At that time her abilities also go up a notch at least as she is shown being able to now reject things that have been completely destroyed down to being burned to complete ash, which previously she had only ever fixed things on an existing body part.\n\nIt's been a while since I've watched the series, but was *she* doing this with her own powers, or was it *the spirits*? Obviously, she has some power since she can summon them and command them, but it never feels like she's actually doing the work. \n\n> In the final arc she becomes so powerful with her reality rejection powers that she can with some assistance circumvent the power of an omnipotent god and make barriers that even that god cannot break or crack despite his ability to literally consume all of reality if he so chose to. \n\nThis sounds really cool and I'm looking forward to the final arc getting animated finally, so I hope I get to see this. That said, I would again ask if this is power is hers or the power of the spirits she commands. \n\n> Saying all this I wish she had gotten a more directly offensive ability as well like mastering kido \n\nThat sounds wicked cool and I wish that Kubo had done this with her character. It seems fitting for her as an ability she would be able to use and master. \n\nOverall I think she does have more development than I gave her credit for, but nowhere near the development as the male characters. I'm not saying it has to be exactly even for male and female characters, but there's a pretty big disparity in the number, power, and development of male vs. female characters (which, again, is symptomatic of a systemic issue in Japanese culture, not just Bleach).",

It\u2019s specific to humans\n\nSo it is directly her power.  I know that\u2019s confusing because her hair pin bits definitely have their own personality so it appears more like she is summoning others to do it for her but it is directly her power.\n\nFrom beginning of the manga till the end she goes from a shy quirky damaged girl who hides her pain behind a cheery voice and lots of smiles to someone who refuses to lose anyone else in her life and heals and helps friend and foe alike. And believes in herself and her friends to the point of being able to reject god himself\n\nShe learns through her intense experiences and the intense people in her life good or bad that hiding your emotions behind either fake happiness or indifference or just coldness to the world is a weakness that puts irreparable rifts between people that in the end could have related to each other.  You could see this with ulquiorra and herself and with shunsui and stark or ichigo and aizen \n\nA lot of the characters in bleach gain more power and more self confidence (which belief in yourself and your abilities and your friends effects characters strengths hugely in bleach) from facing their feelings and emotions and learning to express them.\n\nBut all of this development like I said isn\u2019t spoon fed to you like a lot of mangas like to do.  \n\nI\u2019d say she could have gotten more development yes but that\u2019s a bit specific to her and not to all the women in bleach.  Lots of the other women in bleach are powerful and deep and have a lot going on with them.  \n\nI\u2019d chalk this up to Kubos biggest problem is not that he is a bad writer but that he is a great writer that has a hard time showing you what he is doing when it is subtle.  It takes a few rereads through to pick up all this stuff and so bleach on the scale of anime and manga suffers because most aren\u2019t willing to put in the time to actually pick up all the details on what he is doing and how well laid out his stories are.  \n\nIf everyone took the time to really read deeply into what they saw in bleach I feel a lot more people would have it in their top ten of all time",

I concede that she has more character development than I give her credit for. \n\n> Lots of the other women in bleach are powerful and deep and have a lot going on with them. \n\nDo you feel that the character development of the women is comparable to that of the men in A) Bleach and B) most other manga series? \n\nI'm not saying that the women in manga get *no* development, but I wouldn't say it's comparable to the way the male characters get treated. I'd say this for both Bleach and most other manga. I know that the market is aimed at young men, but that doesn't mean there needs to be such a disparity between the genders. \n\nTo be fair to Japan, women have historically been underrepresented and used as props for male development in most western media too. It's only within the last few decades that western media has improved in terms of representation and breaking traditional gender roles. \n\nI know we got off a tangent on Bleach, but it holds true for Naruto too. And don't get me wrong, I love Naruto (and Bleach), but we can still point out the faults in the things we love (and some might say we should criticize media that we love because we want it to be better).",

In a real high school, there will be dudes motivated entirely by their desire for women, and there will be dudes who are creepy to women. The issue comes in that the rest of the characters and the story itself seemingly do not take real issue with this behavior. I don't demand stories shy away from depictions of sexual harassment or assault, but MHA and the aforementioned Dragon Ball have a serious problem by treating it as a harmless joke, which it definitely isn't. \n\nI seem to remember someone telling me that in the manga, he changes somehow, but I'm an anime-only viewer so I don't know any of that for sure. In any case, him having a character arc demanding improvement from him with only sympathy towards the people he was creepy towards would require heavy lifting on the part of the writing, both to sell it as an honest change and to acknowledge that the story itself definitely screwed up in the chapters beforehand. I imagine that, at best, they just sweep the rest of it under the rug. That's not satisfying, but whatever, I'll take it.",

We never see much of sakura playing an important role. Even kakashi is only needed to play the mentor And nothing more. Infact we get more elaborate back story for sasuke and naruto. While we barely know anything about sakura. Atleast we know kakashi\u2019s life. \nAt no point in the show have they shown sakura and kakashi to be main characters. They are supporting characters and nothing more.  Even towards the end after kaguya is beaten. We see a fight between naruto and sasuke. Sakura and kakashi are not important in that fight. I dont know abt you but to me it feels like sasuke and naruto are the main characters of the show. If i anything its naruto alone who is main protogonist and sasuke plays a deutergonist role. He is more important that supporting character but he isnt necessarily the main character. Whether sasuke was gonna survive or not , we know that naruto was meant to become hokage.",

As you said, she is a high priority target for the world government, but from what we see of her, she doesn't seem useful at all, and that's disappointing because she is a very important character being the one who can actually read the road poneglyphs.\n\nI'm not trying to say all the characters need to be in super difficult fights in order to be good characters, but with how slow One Piece is, it would be nice to see my favorite characters actually contribute something here and there.

Konan exists to support Nagato or Yahiko and their goals. Guren exists to protect a little boy. Chiyo is written as a means to give backstory to Sasori and touch on the themes of generational trauma in war. They all have satisfying changes and growth, but they don't really exist beyond their simple premise. \n\nI think the point they're trying to make is that it's easy to write a character when they only have to exist in a narrow context. It's much harder to write a character like Sakura, who we follow over the course of years and who is meant to be an \"equal\" with the two main characters. I like to believe Kishi would do justice to the characters you mentioned too, but they aren't written to be characters who exist past their given arcs so we will never know.",

Yet we only see like 6 moments of that time, and 5 of them are his fuck ups, making it seem like everything he touched he fucked up. \n\nHe literally was the shadow of the Hokage for 40ish years and handled all of the darkest missions for more than 3 decades. If he only fucked up 5 times, then he was a tremendous asset to the village. His back story was only explored enough to act as a scapegoat for the poor writing of kishimoto and the massive plot holes of the series.",

I still consider it one of my favorite shows, even though I haven't rewatched any of it since I was sixteen.

I don't think there's as much \"talking=free action\" in Naruto (I might be wrong though) than in DB(Z) or Jojo, but the point is, regardless of those \"free actions\", there's no reason for Obito to attempt to convince her in the first place since she has no reason to hesitate and has much more experience under her belt to wrap this up than, again, Rin, and made herself clear about her lack of concern about Obito, who triggered the whole chain of events leading to this war, including declaring it to basically \"Ninja NATO/UN\", which she's already aware of by this point.\n\nIt's less about how fast it happened, but more about \"why are we even talking?\". She made a fool of herself by hesitating for so long against someone she has ALL the reasons to harm, he ended up asking for it. \n\nThere probably would have been much less noise about it if Zetsu regained enough control to hold the incoming kunai or stall long enough, and by the time she tries again, get interrupted by Madara.

Turn out he's secretly suicidal (orphan or not, it's really cheap, it obviously shaped him, but it was an unnecessary conclusion).\n\nMaking a character fail or get foiled while still looking competent isn't even hard, but it's pretty clear Kishimoto didn't think things through considering all the pieces were there for Sakura to \"bag and drag\" (more like \"drag and drop\") this task like a pro, but I'll give that to you, he (almost(?)) always goes for the unnecessary drama when it comes to her decision making in critical moments.",

The only thing you can say about Hinata and Naruto's relationship is their is not enough romance for your liking, not bad romance, her fight against Neji or her stepping up to Pain is not bad romance. Sakura's corny lines about her being ready to leave the village for Sasuke is what I would call bad romance, because it was build from a superficial reason like his looks, not a good enough reason to leave your parents over a boy for something like that. That's like saying Dark is a bad show for not having enough romance or Berserk is bad because of less comedy, when other web series or Seinen have them. Something being in less amount doesn't equates it to being \"bad\" or poorly written when it is barely written by the writer in the first place.",

            "body": "It's frustrating. I actually enjoy Sakura's character, and while the writing is bad, the actual concept and reasoning behind her is decent. A lot of people cite the \"I love you Naruto\" line as something \"Made my blood boil\". Have these people never socialized before? Or been teenagers? \n\nWhat she did was wrong, but she didn't lie. She did love Naruto in a platonic sense, and she loved him enough to try and stop him from pursuing Sasuke for good. Given that she was told by Sai that Naruto was doing all of this for her, a lie to save him from the chase was a perfectly understandable thing for a teenager to do.\n\nShippuden did a great job of showing how close the 2 of them got. I think she genuinely would've ended up with Naruto if fans weren't so blatantly hateful towards her, which wouldn't have changed the trajectory of her character post-Sasori fight. Up until the end of the Pain arc, she's super close with Naruto, despite not having a lot of panel/screen time. Training with him and Kakashi, trying to calm him down in nine-tails mode, screaming for him to save Konoha because she trusts he's the only one who could, and then reuniting with him after Nagato's death and how she embraces him. Sakura loved Naruto, but the \"fan\" toxicity and Studio Pierrot really fucked us over on ever giving her the chance to grow.\n\nOne more thing before I go, in regards of people saying \"she lied to Naruto and still couldn't kill Sasuke. She's useless blah blah blah\", Sakura and Naruto were very similar in that they wanted to be the best. Sakura believed Naruto and Sasuke were amazing, and wanted to \"catch up\". She recognized both for their ability, and that's why she went so hard with her medical training. An ability that she was naturally good at, and could help the team after her failings earlier in the series. She didn't have dreams of being Hokage, but she believed Naruto or Sasuke could be one day, and wanted to be able to support them. When she goes to kill Sasuke, she isn't acting on her own anymore, and is listening to everyone else around her. Unlike Naruto, who has a childlike innocence to him that refuses to bend, Sakura is more realistic. If Sasuke were dead, things WOULD be better, but when she comes to the actual act of doing it, she can't. It wasn't a decision she made, it was a decision she had forced upon her by everyone else. I think that scene gets a lot of unnecessary hate, and I agree that they should've made Sakura's \"betrayal\" a bit better. Hindsight is 20/20, but having her about to stab Sasuke from behind, hesitating enough for him to notice, and then a Susano rib blocking her kunai would've been a way better rewrite that would've gone a long way towards her character rather than not getting the chance to show that while her heart isn't in the act, her brain knows its for the best.\n\nAlso, Sakura is a big reason why Naruto is even alive by the end of Shippuden, and why they have a chance to win. Medical ninja aren't that flashy, and even Kabuto had to completely abandon his medical background to become relevant, but Sakura is by far the best kunoichi in Naruto. Though a close second and third goes to Tsunade and Shizune imo.",

Look at the recent Star Wars trilogy for a very high profile franchise that was dictated by fan backlash. Sakura was setting up to be Naruto's love interest, and would've shown her \"growth\" by gravitating towards Naruto over Sasuke by the end. Instead, by the end of the Pain arc, Kishi had heard the hate post-Sasori (look at how different her character is from the start of Shippuden to a few episodes after Sasori's fight. Kishi was trying to make her a stronger character and presence in the show, but continued hate ended up sidelining her and reverting her back to what she was before). \n\n>and thought naruto would be stupid enough to fall for that\n\nAs a 15 year old being told by an Anbu Spec Ops shinobi that Naruto was doing all of the Sasuke stuff for her, it's not that weird to think that he was still \"in love\" with her from part 1. Let's not forget that Naruto also claimed to love Sakura before, but was only in it because of his competition with Sasuke. He didn't actually love her either, but his was out of rivalry, whereas hers was hoping that he would believe her half truth. I've seen a few translations of the scene, and can't remember the official wording, but \"I love you\" and \"I'm in love with you\" are 2 very similar yet different things. She loved Naruto, and he loved her, but they weren't \"in love\" with each other at this point. Either way, it was bad writing on Kishi's part by making Sakura's entire personality post Sasori about \"love\". She only has one other goal in the show, and thats: \n\n>I need to catch up to naruto and sasuke\n\nBeing the weakest in the squad, despite being the smartest in the tests, and with the best chakra control of the other 2 would definitely be disheartening. Not to mention that Kakashi does basically nothing for her, and she only undergoes any growth with Tsunade as her teacher. And being 16/17 by the end of the series, it makes perfect sense why she wants to prove herself. She didn't \"whine\" about not being as strong, so much as she knew she wasn't. It was her motivator, just like how Naruto was always trying to prove himself to everyone else who doubted him. Sakura was doubted by everyone + she doubted herself way more than Naruto ever did. Being the 3rd \"MC\", and not really being a MC also hurt her development. Kakashi undergoes more growth than Sakura does, which is absolutely insane when you think about that. Kakashi is amazing, and is one of my favorite characters in anime, but dedicating some of his development into Sakura would've gone a long way. Or Kishi actually committing to the Sakura at the start of Shippuden who isn't love locked by Sasuke and is a super capable Shinobi that even Kakashi and Naruto were shocked by. She doesn't get anything new until the 100 healings at the end of the series.\n\nMeanwhile Sasuke gets to show off a bunch of jutsu he learns with Orochimaru, gets the EMS, Naruto gets 50 new rasengans, sage mode, kcm, and then the duo become reincarnations of Indra/Ashura.\n\nHell, Madara shows more new jutsu and he's only in the last arc. It's bizarre how Sakura gets a summoning and 100 healings, and that's it. She's a healer, yes, but she had years to learn one or two long range jutsu. Especially with her incredible chakra control it could've been something awesome.\n\nThat said, when she actually connects with a punch, it's dope. She is strong enough to crack Susano ribs if Tsunade is anything to go off of, and I wish we could've seen that when she \"distracts\" Madara before being stabbed. Having him pop a partial Susano and underestimating her, just for her to break through and him having to dodge before stabbing her would've been an awesome moment that would've ended up the same. It also would've made her catching Kaguya feel less shoehorned in at the end.",

She loved Naruto, and he loved her, but they weren't \"in love\" with each other at this point.\n\nRegardless of the official translation, even if she just said \"suki da yo\" or \"daisuki\" or any other word that means like or love in Japanese it doesn't matter. She was framing that as a love confession. She was lying to Naruto to try and stop him. It was 100% emotional manipulation. She wasn't saying that she loved him in a platonic way because that would mean absolutely nothing in the story. That wouldn't have stopped him. Sakura was willing to go back to the village with Naruto and try to forget about Sasuke. That is bad on both sides, and neither of them would have ended up happy. Stop defending this point because there is no good side to it. It doesn't matter that they're 15, it doesn't matter that there's platonic love, what she did was horrible. I think I've argued with you about this before because this sounds like the same argument I had with someone on here.\n\nSo let me ask you this. Put yourself in Naruto's shoes. How would you feel if a close friend suddenly said they like you after years of claiming to love someone else? Would you just blindly accept that? What if you did and the whole thing turned out to be a sham? How would that make you feel? Would you think that false relationship would have been worth it?\n\nTake just a few minutes to think about what would happen if Naruto said yes and the show just stopped there.

It's obvious that you've never been emotionally manipulated, because if you have, you would never defend what she did.",

Would you think that false relationship would have been worth it?\n\nI have been told that someone close liked me because she didn't like me having eyes for anyone else, and I called them on it, despite liking them as well once upon a time. I have had a relationship FUCKING END because someone's jealousy towards her friend/my girlfriend was used to break us up. Naruto did the right thing for calling her on it, which isn't the argument. But you know what wasn't a factor in it? The jealous \"friend\" wasn't trying to stop me from dating a person who has been labeled as a terrorist and had the opportunity to murder me, only being pulled back by another terrorist who experimented on human children. \n\nBut do you know what it did? It made me rethink whether the relationship was worth it. Naruto never saw accepted that Sasuke was a psychopath, whereas Sakura did. \n\n>Take just a few minutes to think about what would happen if Naruto said yes and the show just stopped there. I'm not talking about Sasuke or the war or anything other than Naruto and Sakura in a relationship. Do you honestly think that would have worked with her \"confession\" being the catalyst. \n\nThe show wouldn't end based off a relationship. If we are talking he never ends up with Hinata, and she never ends up with Sasuke, they'd probably still end up happy. Until the writing makes him call her on it, she could have been 100% truthful. She wouldn't be \"lying to herself\". Would Kishi have said that she was lying if he had believed her? The two of them had many moments throughout Shippuden that showed that they would've worked together, much better than the ones they ended up with. They would've been fine, and Boruto might have never happened as Neji wouldn't have to die for Hinata and Naruto, and Sakura x Naruto would've had a different kid, more in line with Sarada since Sakura is much more hands on in parenting than Hinata seems to be. \n\n\n>It's obvious that you've never been emotionally manipulated, because if you have, you would never defend what she did.\n\nLOL yes, I've never been emotionally manipulated. That isn't what happened when I was 17 with an overjealous \"friend\" and \"best friend\" to my then girlfriend.\n\nYou clearly don't understand the process of writing. Would she have been lying if he didn't call her on it? If anything, he'd be just as bad, as he was only interested in Sakura because he was jealous of Sakura and wanted what she had. Which he grows out of in Shippuden, but they had connected in multiple ways, where she completely trusts Naruto, and Naruto completely trusts basically everyone, so no issue there.",

He would have gotten the manegko sharingan that way sooner.. Saskue said he went with Orochimaru to get stronger and that he was done playing games with the Konah students. So what do you mean he wouldn't? Itcahci told him to kill Naruto his best friend. He said kill your best friend. He lifted him up with one hand and tried pushing the chidori into his chest. After the fight was over he changed his mind because he saw how far Naruto went for him. \n\nYou trying to spin the narrative to it\nWon't work to awkken his mangeyo sharingan it just weird man. Also it inaccurate because that's how you awkken it. Killing someone or watching someone you love. \n\n>Same with Naruto and Hinata. It was completely one sided.\n\nNo they both talked in school, chuni exams, post kiba fight, Shippuden intro and in between missions to name a few. Naruto was not dismissive of her at all and always responded to her. Saskue never wanted to be around Sakura. Sasuke loved Naruto more in fact. Sasuke supported Naruto as a rival and friend. Not Sakura. There was no exchange of love there. \n\nIf you don't like Hinata it's fine. She's an secondary character we like but why even bother compare her to Sakura if she's suppose to be a main character? \n\nLol it's funny because the only persons who did talk to Sakura was Tsunade and Kakashi. And mostly Kakashi because the Tsunade thing was only in training. But no one reached out to her lol\n\nNaruto had everyone from main character like Gara and secondary characters like Hinata to support him.",

I know that he spared him because he didn't want to kill his friend and submit to Itachi's will. How about you \"Watch it again on NarutoGet\". Or Netflix, or crunchyroll, or a myriad of other official places that should be readily available.\n\nWhen you realize you're wrong, please don't respond and apologize. You have wasted enough time.",

She's useless. She didn't teach anyone anything to help them be better. She didn't help anyone grow. Not even to the supporting characters. You only see this in Boruto 1 time when she's training with Sasuke's daughter. But that's it. \n\n\n>he didn't want to kill his friend\n\nYeah that's what I said dummy \ud83e\udd23",

Any of his friends being killed in front of him would've set it off. It could've been Sakura, Shikamaru, Choji, Kiba, etc., but Kishi chose Hinata because he knew the fans wanted them together, and it was the basic pairing everyone assumed from day 1. There was no blood oath involved, and all of his 6 tails was directed at Pain, why would he attack an already dead Hinata? \n\nThey had to make a movie about their story to make it make any sense outside of \"yeah, we shipped them\", and while Naruto never showed any romantic interest back, we need to get them for Boruto\".",

He said he wouldn't rely on Kyubi's powers and gave his words and he never goes back on his words cuz thats his nindo but he broke his nindo for Hinata. Blood Oath from chunin exams bruh. In manga he circled around Hinata's body to attack Pain (why didnt he just went over Hinata's body and instead circled around her?) and when he saw her saying Naruto he got more angry at Pain and then made a Bijudama to launch at Pain.\n\nIts not even true lmao, the movie's production began way before Naruto's ending, thats the reason why u dont see Naruto in his SPSM cloak, Sasuke is seen without his Rinnegan in one of the movie shots and Hinata doesnt use any of her jutsus from War Arc. Movie was already planned. And its the K12 couple which makes the most sense canonically (not including fillers) and Naruto just needed to remember her confession which he forcefully had to forget bcz of Kyubi transformation.",

When Tatsumaki hits Genos in OPM, Megumi hits Yuji in JJK, Sakura hits Naruto, Nami hits anyone in One Piece, it\u2019s seen as slap stick humour. None of these characters are considered abusive \n\nWhen Kousei from Your Lie in April gets hit by his mother it\u2019s depicted as actual abuse. When Kushina hits Naruto in that one movie it\u2019s not abuse. Both acts are fundamentally the same a mother hitting her child, but due to Japanese cultural norms one of them is an actual depiction of abuse while the other is just slap stick humour. Naruto is never physically or emotionally traumatized from being hit by Kushina or Sakura",

And I know they made a movie, but when the manga ran for 15 years and 700 chapters there should be at least some development of their relationship in the actual main story",

Sakura might be the only one who knew Hinata loved Naruto a lot and yet she tried to confess to Naruto.\n\n>And fillers can\u2019t show any emotional progression of the character\n\nwhat does that mean here?\n\nThey made fun of it bcz they showed her saying Naruto-kun. In manga she literally teamed up with Naruto when they were searching for Sasuke and she didnt uttered Naruto-kun even once there. They also made fun of her by showing her fainting, the thing is both these things are filler. And u have to be out of your mind if u think thats the only thing to her character. What happened to her being the only kunoichi from Konoha 12 to have a good backstory? What happened to her hardworking to change herself? What happened to her being the only kunoichi from K12 to have an actual goal and dream as to why she became a kunoichi? What happened to the fact that she was changing the Hyuga clan with Neji and proving both branches are equal? Naruto is a huge part of her life and the reason why she started changing, just so u know. People who say her entire character is only Naruto are either haters or didnt get her character. And she never stalked him canonically, its filler and anime made that up.\n\nHe didnt hurt her in 6 tails while hurt Jiraiya in 3 tails, pounced on Kakashi in 2 tails and hurt Sakura in 4 tails, like this there are other examples of him loving her subconsciously. So there are moments and development of their relationship in manga. They even went on many dates (3 of them are officially drawn too).",

She said she started changing after Naruto cheered for her and during her match with Neji said she wont run away anymore. And those changes are visible, she didnt run away from Pain even tho she knew she wont excel. She trained very hard and mastered TLF, was equal to Neji in War Arc and even saved him from a White Zetsu, both her and Neji's Air Palms were equal and so they were able to combine both Air Palms to make Air Wall Palm. She also the only Hyuga to make a variation to 64 palms by combining TLF and 64 palms, even Neji wasnt able to do that.",

Who she is and how she acts do not change at all throughout the story until the 3rd time Skip. From chapter 1 to chapter 700 she never becomes more than a shy girl who loves Naruto. Like I said there was a lot of potential w her back story and exploring her life in her sisters shadow, but she had so little screen time that it\u2019s never explored or fleshed out. We don\u2019t actually see her training or working hard or changing the hyuga plan. She says that\u2019s what she wants to do and then one day during the war arc we find out she did it",

Most of the characters have a tragic backstory, but they get more development than she does. \n\n> she sacrifices herself to be a way to save her friends.\n\nA sacrifice to save her friends is obviously a noble thing to do and does give her agency, so I don't want to discredit this part of her story. \n\n> she slowly turns ulquiorra from a cold disconnected emotionless person into someone that in the very last moments in his life able to feel and understand the value of the human heart and relationships with others.\n\nThis is obviously a positive thing for her character to do, but once again relegates her to a traditional gender role of existing to further the development of a male character, rather than defining her own character. \n\n> At that time her abilities also go up a notch at least as she is shown being able to now reject things that have been completely destroyed down to being burned to complete ash, which previously she had only ever fixed things on an existing body part.\n\nIt's been a while since I've watched the series, but was *she* doing this with her own powers, or was it *the spirits*? Obviously, she has some power since she can summon them and command them, but it never feels like she's actually doing the work. \n\n> In the final arc she becomes so powerful with her reality rejection powers that she can with some assistance circumvent the power of an omnipotent god and make barriers that even that god cannot break or crack despite his ability to literally consume all of reality if he so chose to. \n\nThis sounds really cool and I'm looking forward to the final arc getting animated finally, so I hope I get to see this. That said, I would again ask if this is power is hers or the power of the spirits she commands. \n\n> Saying all this I wish she had gotten a more directly offensive ability as well like mastering kido \n\nThat sounds wicked cool and I wish that Kubo had done this with her character. It seems fitting for her as an ability she would be able to use and master. \n\nOverall I think she does have more development than I gave her credit for, but nowhere near the development as the male characters. I'm not saying it has to be exactly even for male and female characters, but there's a pretty big disparity in the number, power, and development of male vs. female characters (which, again, is symptomatic of a systemic issue in Japanese culture, not just Bleach).",

It\u2019s specific to humans\n\nSo it is directly her power.  I know that\u2019s confusing because her hair pin bits definitely have their own personality so it appears more like she is summoning others to do it for her but it is directly her power.\n\nFrom beginning of the manga till the end she goes from a shy quirky damaged girl who hides her pain behind a cheery voice and lots of smiles to someone who refuses to lose anyone else in her life and heals and helps friend and foe alike. And believes in herself and her friends to the point of being able to reject god himself\n\nShe learns through her intense experiences and the intense people in her life good or bad that hiding your emotions behind either fake happiness or indifference or just coldness to the world is a weakness that puts irreparable rifts between people that in the end could have related to each other.  You could see this with ulquiorra and herself and with shunsui and stark or ichigo and aizen \n\nA lot of the characters in bleach gain more power and more self confidence (which belief in yourself and your abilities and your friends effects characters strengths hugely in bleach) from facing their feelings and emotions and learning to express them.\n\nBut all of this development like I said isn\u2019t spoon fed to you like a lot of mangas like to do.  \n\nI\u2019d say she could have gotten more development yes but that\u2019s a bit specific to her and not to all the women in bleach.  Lots of the other women in bleach are powerful and deep and have a lot going on with them.  \n\nI\u2019d chalk this up to Kubos biggest problem is not that he is a bad writer but that he is a great writer that has a hard time showing you what he is doing when it is subtle.  It takes a few rereads through to pick up all this stuff and so bleach on the scale of anime and manga suffers because most aren\u2019t willing to put in the time to actually pick up all the details on what he is doing and how well laid out his stories are.  \n\nIf everyone took the time to really read deeply into what they saw in bleach I feel a lot more people would have it in their top ten of all time",

I concede that she has more character development than I give her credit for. \n\n> Lots of the other women in bleach are powerful and deep and have a lot going on with them. \n\nDo you feel that the character development of the women is comparable to that of the men in A) Bleach and B) most other manga series? \n\nI'm not saying that the women in manga get *no* development, but I wouldn't say it's comparable to the way the male characters get treated. I'd say this for both Bleach and most other manga. I know that the market is aimed at young men, but that doesn't mean there needs to be such a disparity between the genders. \n\nTo be fair to Japan, women have historically been underrepresented and used as props for male development in most western media too. It's only within the last few decades that western media has improved in terms of representation and breaking traditional gender roles. \n\nI know we got off a tangent on Bleach, but it holds true for Naruto too. And don't get me wrong, I love Naruto (and Bleach), but we can still point out the faults in the things we love (and some might say we should criticize media that we love because we want it to be better).",

In a real high school, there will be dudes motivated entirely by their desire for women, and there will be dudes who are creepy to women. The issue comes in that the rest of the characters and the story itself seemingly do not take real issue with this behavior. I don't demand stories shy away from depictions of sexual harassment or assault, but MHA and the aforementioned Dragon Ball have a serious problem by treating it as a harmless joke, which it definitely isn't. \n\nI seem to remember someone telling me that in the manga, he changes somehow, but I'm an anime-only viewer so I don't know any of that for sure. In any case, him having a character arc demanding improvement from him with only sympathy towards the people he was creepy towards would require heavy lifting on the part of the writing, both to sell it as an honest change and to acknowledge that the story itself definitely screwed up in the chapters beforehand. I imagine that, at best, they just sweep the rest of it under the rug. That's not satisfying, but whatever, I'll take it.",

Sasuke and naruto are the reincarnations of sage of 6 path\u2019s children. We are constantly shown naruto and sauske\u2019s growth through out the story more or less around the same time. We never see much of sakura playing an important role. Even kakashi is only needed to play the mentor And nothing more. Infact we get more elaborate back story for sasuke and naruto. While we barely know anything about sakura. Atleast we know kakashi\u2019s life. \nAt no point in the show have they shown sakura and kakashi to be main characters. They are supporting characters and nothing more.  Even towards the end after kaguya is beaten. We see a fight between naruto and sasuke. Sakura and kakashi are not important in that fight. I dont know abt you but to me it feels like sasuke and naruto are the main characters of the show. If i anything its naruto alone who is main protogonist and sasuke plays a deutergonist role. He is more important that supporting character but he isnt necessarily the main character. Whether sasuke was gonna survive or not , we know that naruto was meant to become hokage.",

She made a fool of herself by hesitating for so long against someone she has ALL the reasons to harm, he ended up asking for it. \n\nThere probably would have been much less noise about it if Zetsu regained enough control to hold the incoming kunai or stall long enough, and by the time she tries again, get interrupted by Madara.

Turn out he's secretly suicidal (orphan or not, it's really cheap, it obviously shaped him, but it was an unnecessary conclusion).\n\nMaking a character fail or get foiled while still looking competent isn't even hard, but it's pretty clear Kishimoto didn't think things through considering all the pieces were there for Sakura to \"bag and drag\" (more like \"drag and drop\") this task like a pro, but I'll give that to you, he (almost(?)) always goes for the unnecessary drama when it comes to her decision making in critical moments.",

The only thing you can say about Hinata and Naruto's relationship is their is not enough romance for your liking, not bad romance, her fight against Neji or her stepping up to Pain is not bad romance. Sakura's corny lines about her being ready to leave the village for Sasuke is what I would call bad romance, because it was build from a superficial reason like his looks, not a good enough reason to leave your parents over a boy for something like that. That's like saying Dark is a bad show for not having enough romance or Berserk is bad because of less comedy, when other web series or Seinen have them. Something being in less amount doesn't equates it to being \"bad\" or poorly written when it is barely written by the writer in the first place.",

Look at the recent Star Wars trilogy for a very high profile franchise that was dictated by fan backlash. Sakura was setting up to be Naruto's love interest, and would've shown her \"growth\" by gravitating towards Naruto over Sasuke by the end. Instead, by the end of the Pain arc, Kishi had heard the hate post-Sasori (look at how different her character is from the start of Shippuden to a few episodes after Sasori's fight. Kishi was trying to make her a stronger character and presence in the show, but continued hate ended up sidelining her and reverting her back to what she was before). \n\n>and thought naruto would be stupid enough to fall for that\n\nAs a 15 year old being told by an Anbu Spec Ops shinobi that Naruto was doing all of the Sasuke stuff for her, it's not that weird to think that he was still \"in love\" with her from part 1. Let's not forget that Naruto also claimed to love Sakura before, but was only in it because of his competition with Sasuke. He didn't actually love her either, but his was out of rivalry, whereas hers was hoping that he would believe her half truth. I've seen a few translations of the scene, and can't remember the official wording, but \"I love you\" and \"I'm in love with you\" are 2 very similar yet different things. She loved Naruto, and he loved her, but they weren't \"in love\" with each other at this point. Either way, it was bad writing on Kishi's part by making Sakura's entire personality post Sasori about \"love\". She only has one other goal in the show, and thats: \n\n>I need to catch up to naruto and sasuke\n\nBeing the weakest in the squad, despite being the smartest in the tests, and with the best chakra control of the other 2 would definitely be disheartening. Not to mention that Kakashi does basically nothing for her, and she only undergoes any growth with Tsunade as her teacher. And being 16/17 by the end of the series, it makes perfect sense why she wants to prove herself. She didn't \"whine\" about not being as strong, so much as she knew she wasn't. It was her motivator, just like how Naruto was always trying to prove himself to everyone else who doubted him. Sakura was doubted by everyone + she doubted herself way more than Naruto ever did. Being the 3rd \"MC\", and not really being a MC also hurt her development. Kakashi undergoes more growth than Sakura does, which is absolutely insane when you think about that. Kakashi is amazing, and is one of my favorite characters in anime, but dedicating some of his development into Sakura would've gone a long way. Or Kishi actually committing to the Sakura at the start of Shippuden who isn't love locked by Sasuke and is a super capable Shinobi that even Kakashi and Naruto were shocked by. She doesn't get anything new until the 100 healings at the end of the series.\n\nMeanwhile Sasuke gets to show off a bunch of jutsu he learns with Orochimaru, gets the EMS, Naruto gets 50 new rasengans, sage mode, kcm, and then the duo become reincarnations of Indra/Ashura.\n\nHell, Madara shows more new jutsu and he's only in the last arc. It's bizarre how Sakura gets a summoning and 100 healings, and that's it. She's a healer, yes, but she had years to learn one or two long range jutsu. Especially with her incredible chakra control it could've been something awesome.\n\nThat said, when she actually connects with a punch, it's dope. She is strong enough to crack Susano ribs if Tsunade is anything to go off of, and I wish we could've seen that when she \"distracts\" Madara before being stabbed. Having him pop a partial Susano and underestimating her, just for her to break through and him having to dodge before stabbing her would've been an awesome moment that would've ended up the same. It also would've made her catching Kaguya feel less shoehorned in at the end.",

I have had a relationship FUCKING END because someone's jealousy towards her friend/my girlfriend was used to break us up. Naruto did the right thing for calling her on it, which isn't the argument. But you know what wasn't a factor in it? The jealous \"friend\" wasn't trying to stop me from dating a person who has been labeled as a terrorist and had the opportunity to murder me, only being pulled back by another terrorist who experimented on human children. \n\nBut do you know what it did? It made me rethink whether the relationship was worth it. Naruto never saw accepted that Sasuke was a psychopath, whereas Sakura did. \n\n>Take just a few minutes to think about what would happen if Naruto said yes and the show just stopped there. I'm not talking about Sasuke or the war or anything other than Naruto and Sakura in a relationship. Do you honestly think that would have worked with her \"confession\" being the catalyst. \n\nThe show wouldn't end based off a relationship. If we are talking he never ends up with Hinata, and she never ends up with Sasuke, they'd probably still end up happy. Until the writing makes him call her on it, she could have been 100% truthful. She wouldn't be \"lying to herself\". Would Kishi have said that she was lying if he had believed her? The two of them had many moments throughout Shippuden that showed that they would've worked together, much better than the ones they ended up with. They would've been fine, and Boruto might have never happened as Neji wouldn't have to die for Hinata and Naruto, and Sakura x Naruto would've had a different kid, more in line with Sarada since Sakura is much more hands on in parenting than Hinata seems to be. \n\n\n>It's obvious that you've never been emotionally manipulated, because if you have, you would never defend what she did.\n\nLOL yes, I've never been emotionally manipulated. That isn't what happened when I was 17 with an overjealous \"friend\" and \"best friend\" to my then girlfriend.\n\nYou clearly don't understand the process of writing. Would she have been lying if he didn't call her on it? If anything, he'd be just as bad, as he was only interested in Sakura because he was jealous of Sakura and wanted what she had. Which he grows out of in Shippuden, but they had connected in multiple ways, where she completely trusts Naruto, and Naruto completely trusts basically everyone, so no issue there.",

While some scenes could have been written better, deadlines, editor comments, and Kishi admitting he isn't great at female characters is why I can probably write a better Sakura scene, but I wouldn't be able to think up the concepts that Kishi had in the first place, so it's a good thing I wasn't the author. He could've used someone there to help with the side characters though. Most are pretty bad.",

            "body": "> Not JUST because it was Hinata\n\nOf course, I though that was implied. But had he killed Sakura it would have not been the last straw. Saskue yes or sure. Not a Sakura figure. Sakura never gave anything to Naruto. She never helped him grow. Saskue did and others like Kakashi and support characters. I'm not even sure why Sakura was a main character because she never gave anything to Naruto as a character. Or even Sasuke. \n\n>Sasuke even says that he refused to kill Naruto because he wouldn't get stronger the way Itachi expected him to. \n\n\nWhere? He would have gotten the manegko sharingan that way sooner.. Saskue said he went with Orochimaru to get stronger and that he was done playing games with the Konah students. So what do you mean he wouldn't? Itcahci told him to kill Naruto his best friend. He said kill your best friend. He lifted him up with one hand and tried pushing the chidori into his chest. After the fight was over he changed his mind because he saw how far Naruto went for him. \n\nYou trying to spin the narrative to it\nWon't work to awkken his mangeyo sharingan it just weird man. Also it inaccurate because that's how you awkken it. Killing someone or watching someone you love. \n\n>Same with Naruto and Hinata. It was completely one sided.\n\nNo they both talked in school, chuni exams, post kiba fight, Shippuden intro and in between missions to name a few. Naruto was not dismissive of her at all and always responded to her. Saskue never wanted to be around Sakura. Sasuke loved Naruto more in fact. Sasuke supported Naruto as a rival and friend. Not Sakura. There was no exchange of love there. \n\nIf you don't like Hinata it's fine. She's an secondary character we like but why even bother compare her to Sakura if she's suppose to be a main character? \n\nLol it's funny because the only persons who did talk to Sakura was Tsunade and Kakashi. And mostly Kakashi because the Tsunade thing was only in training. But no one reached out to her lol\n\nNaruto had everyone from main character like Gara and secondary characters like Hinata to support him.",

She's useless. She didn't teach anyone anything to help them be better. She didn't help anyone grow. Not even to the supporting characters.

Any of his friends being killed in front of him would've set it off. It could've been Sakura, Shikamaru, Choji, Kiba, etc., but Kishi chose Hinata because he knew the fans wanted them together, and it was the basic pairing everyone assumed from day 1. There was no blood oath involved, and all of his 6 tails was directed at Pain, why would he attack an already dead Hinata? \n\nThey had to make a movie about their story to make it make any sense outside of \"yeah, we shipped them\", and while Naruto never showed any romantic interest back, we need to get them for Boruto\".",

He said he wouldn't rely on Kyubi's powers and gave his words and he never goes back on his words cuz thats his nindo but he broke his nindo for Hinata. Blood Oath from chunin exams bruh. In manga he circled around Hinata's body to attack Pain (why didnt he just went over Hinata's body and instead circled around her?) and when he saw her saying Naruto he got more angry at Pain and then made a Bijudama to launch at Pain.\n\nIts not even true lmao, the movie's production began way before Naruto's ending, thats the reason why u dont see Naruto in his SPSM cloak, Sasuke is seen without his Rinnegan in one of the movie shots and Hinata doesnt use any of her jutsus from War Arc. Movie was already planned. And its the K12 couple which makes the most sense canonically (not including fillers) and Naruto just needed to remember her confession which he forcefully had to forget bcz of Kyubi transformation.",

In manga she literally teamed up with Naruto when they were searching for Sasuke and she didnt uttered Naruto-kun even once there. They also made fun of her by showing her fainting, the thing is both these things are filler. And u have to be out of your mind if u think thats the only thing to her character. What happened to her being the only kunoichi from Konoha 12 to have a good backstory? What happened to her hardworking to change herself? What happened to her being the only kunoichi from K12 to have an actual goal and dream as to why she became a kunoichi? What happened to the fact that she was changing the Hyuga clan with Neji and proving both branches are equal? Naruto is a huge part of her life and the reason why she started changing, just so u know. People who say her entire character is only Naruto are either haters or didnt get her character. And she never stalked him canonically, its filler and anime made that up.\n\nHe didnt hurt her in 6 tails while hurt Jiraiya in 3 tails, pounced on Kakashi in 2 tails and hurt Sakura in 4 tails, like this there are other examples of him loving her subconsciously. So there are moments and development of their relationship in manga. They even went on many dates (3 of them are officially drawn too).",

But when you give a character a strong backstory and then just forget about them for the next 600 chapters what was the point? Her entire character is defined by her relationship to Naruto which is exactly what the original post was criticizing in the first place and why people dislike Sakuras writing.",

And her changing the hyuga clan with Neji was not in episode 1, it was shown in War Arc. \n\nAnd her development wasnt forgotten. She said she started changing after Naruto cheered for her and during her match with Neji said she wont run away anymore. And those changes are visible, she didnt run away from Pain even tho she knew she wont excel. She trained very hard and mastered TLF, was equal to Neji in War Arc and even saved him from a White Zetsu, both her and Neji's Air Palms were equal and so they were able to combine both Air Palms to make Air Wall Palm. She also the only Hyuga to make a variation to 64 palms by combining TLF and 64 palms, even Neji wasnt able to do that.",

Who she is and how she acts do not change at all throughout the story until the 3rd time Skip. From chapter 1 to chapter 700 she never becomes more than a shy girl who loves Naruto. Like I said there was a lot of potential w her back story and exploring her life in her sisters shadow, but she had so little screen time that it\u2019s never explored or fleshed out. We don\u2019t actually see her training or working hard or changing the hyuga plan. She says that\u2019s what she wants to do and then one day during the war arc we find out she did it",

Most of the characters have a tragic backstory, but they get more development than she does. \n\n> she sacrifices herself to be a way to save her friends.\n\nA sacrifice to save her friends is obviously a noble thing to do and does give her agency, so I don't want to discredit this part of her story. \n\n> she slowly turns ulquiorra from a cold disconnected emotionless person into someone that in the very last moments in his life able to feel and understand the value of the human heart and relationships with others.\n\nThis is obviously a positive thing for her character to do, but once again relegates her to a traditional gender role of existing to further the development of a male character, rather than defining her own character. \n\n> At that time her abilities also go up a notch at least as she is shown being able to now reject things that have been completely destroyed down to being burned to complete ash, which previously she had only ever fixed things on an existing body part.\n\nIt's been a while since I've watched the series, but was *she* doing this with her own powers, or was it *the spirits*? Obviously, she has some power since she can summon them and command them, but it never feels like she's actually doing the work. \n\n> In the final arc she becomes so powerful with her reality rejection powers that she can with some assistance circumvent the power of an omnipotent god and make barriers that even that god cannot break or crack despite his ability to literally consume all of reality if he so chose to. \n\nThis sounds really cool and I'm looking forward to the final arc getting animated finally, so I hope I get to see this. That said, I would again ask if this is power is hers or the power of the spirits she commands. \n\n> Saying all this I wish she had gotten a more directly offensive ability as well like mastering kido \n\nThat sounds wicked cool and I wish that Kubo had done this with her character. It seems fitting for her as an ability she would be able to use and master. \n\nOverall I think she does have more development than I gave her credit for, but nowhere near the development as the male characters. I'm not saying it has to be exactly even for male and female characters, but there's a pretty big disparity in the number, power, and development of male vs. female characters (which, again, is symptomatic of a systemic issue in Japanese culture, not just Bleach).",

                    "body": "Her power is a fullbring power which is the ability to draw out the soul of an object and and bend it to your will.  It\u2019s specific to humans\n\nSo it is directly her power.  I know that\u2019s confusing because her hair pin bits definitely have their own personality so it appears more like she is summoning others to do it for her but it is directly her power.\n\nFrom beginning of the manga till the end she goes from a shy quirky damaged girl who hides her pain behind a cheery voice and lots of smiles to someone who refuses to lose anyone else in her life and heals and helps friend and foe alike. And believes in herself and her friends to the point of being able to reject god himself\n\nShe learns through her intense experiences and the intense people in her life good or bad that hiding your emotions behind either fake happiness or indifference or just coldness to the world is a weakness that puts irreparable rifts between people that in the end could have related to each other.  You could see this with ulquiorra and herself and with shunsui and stark or ichigo and aizen \n\nA lot of the characters in bleach gain more power and more self confidence (which belief in yourself and your abilities and your friends effects characters strengths hugely in bleach) from facing their feelings and emotions and learning to express them.\n\nBut all of this development like I said isn\u2019t spoon fed to you like a lot of mangas like to do.  \n\nI\u2019d say she could have gotten more development yes but that\u2019s a bit specific to her and not to all the women in bleach.  Lots of the other women in bleach are powerful and deep and have a lot going on with them.  \n\nI\u2019d chalk this up to Kubos biggest problem is not that he is a bad writer but that he is a great writer that has a hard time showing you what he is doing when it is subtle.  It takes a few rereads through to pick up all this stuff and so bleach on the scale of anime and manga suffers because most aren\u2019t willing to put in the time to actually pick up all the details on what he is doing and how well laid out his stories are.  \n\nIf everyone took the time to really read deeply into what they saw in bleach I feel a lot more people would have it in their top ten of all time",

I concede that she has more character development than I give her credit for. \n\n> Lots of the other women in bleach are powerful and deep and have a lot going on with them. \n\nDo you feel that the character development of the women is comparable to that of the men in A) Bleach and B) most other manga series? \n\nI'm not saying that the women in manga get *no* development, but I wouldn't say it's comparable to the way the male characters get treated. I'd say this for both Bleach and most other manga. I know that the market is aimed at young men, but that doesn't mean there needs to be such a disparity between the genders. \n\nTo be fair to Japan, women have historically been underrepresented and used as props for male development in most western media too. It's only within the last few decades that western media has improved in terms of representation and breaking traditional gender roles. \n\nI know we got off a tangent on Bleach, but it holds true for Naruto too. And don't get me wrong, I love Naruto (and Bleach), but we can still point out the faults in the things we love (and some might say we should criticize media that we love because we want it to be better).",

The only thing you can say about Hinata and Naruto's relationship is their is not enough romance for your liking, not bad romance, her fight against Neji or her stepping up to Pain is not bad romance. Sakura's corny lines about her being ready to leave the village for Sasuke is what I would call bad romance, because it was build from a superficial reason like his looks, not a good enough reason to leave your parents over a boy for something like that. That's like saying Dark is a bad show for not having enough romance or Berserk is bad because of less comedy, when other web series or Seinen have them. Something being in less amount doesn't equates it to being \"bad\" or poorly written when it is barely written by the writer in the first place.",

Look at the recent Star Wars trilogy for a very high profile franchise that was dictated by fan backlash. Sakura was setting up to be Naruto's love interest, and would've shown her \"growth\" by gravitating towards Naruto over Sasuke by the end. Instead, by the end of the Pain arc, Kishi had heard the hate post-Sasori (look at how different her character is from the start of Shippuden to a few episodes after Sasori's fight. Kishi was trying to make her a stronger character and presence in the show, but continued hate ended up sidelining her and reverting her back to what she was before). \n\n>and thought naruto would be stupid enough to fall for that\n\nAs a 15 year old being told by an Anbu Spec Ops shinobi that Naruto was doing all of the Sasuke stuff for her, it's not that weird to think that he was still \"in love\" with her from part 1. Let's not forget that Naruto also claimed to love Sakura before, but was only in it because of his competition with Sasuke. He didn't actually love her either, but his was out of rivalry, whereas hers was hoping that he would believe her half truth. I've seen a few translations of the scene, and can't remember the official wording, but \"I love you\" and \"I'm in love with you\" are 2 very similar yet different things. She loved Naruto, and he loved her, but they weren't \"in love\" with each other at this point. Either way, it was bad writing on Kishi's part by making Sakura's entire personality post Sasori about \"love\". She only has one other goal in the show, and thats: \n\n>I need to catch up to naruto and sasuke\n\nBeing the weakest in the squad, despite being the smartest in the tests, and with the best chakra control of the other 2 would definitely be disheartening. Not to mention that Kakashi does basically nothing for her, and she only undergoes any growth with Tsunade as her teacher. And being 16/17 by the end of the series, it makes perfect sense why she wants to prove herself. She didn't \"whine\" about not being as strong, so much as she knew she wasn't. It was her motivator, just like how Naruto was always trying to prove himself to everyone else who doubted him. Sakura was doubted by everyone + she doubted herself way more than Naruto ever did. Being the 3rd \"MC\", and not really being a MC also hurt her development. Kakashi undergoes more growth than Sakura does, which is absolutely insane when you think about that. Kakashi is amazing, and is one of my favorite characters in anime, but dedicating some of his development into Sakura would've gone a long way. Or Kishi actually committing to the Sakura at the start of Shippuden who isn't love locked by Sasuke and is a super capable Shinobi that even Kakashi and Naruto were shocked by. She doesn't get anything new until the 100 healings at the end of the series.\n\nMeanwhile Sasuke gets to show off a bunch of jutsu he learns with Orochimaru, gets the EMS, Naruto gets 50 new rasengans, sage mode, kcm, and then the duo become reincarnations of Indra/Ashura.\n\nHell, Madara shows more new jutsu and he's only in the last arc. It's bizarre how Sakura gets a summoning and 100 healings, and that's it. She's a healer, yes, but she had years to learn one or two long range jutsu. Especially with her incredible chakra control it could've been something awesome.\n\nThat said, when she actually connects with a punch, it's dope. She is strong enough to crack Susano ribs if Tsunade is anything to go off of, and I wish we could've seen that when she \"distracts\" Madara before being stabbed. Having him pop a partial Susano and underestimating her, just for her to break through and him having to dodge before stabbing her would've been an awesome moment that would've ended up the same. It also would've made her catching Kaguya feel less shoehorned in at the end.",

I have had a relationship FUCKING END because someone's jealousy towards her friend/my girlfriend was used to break us up. Naruto did the right thing for calling her on it, which isn't the argument. But you know what wasn't a factor in it? The jealous \"friend\" wasn't trying to stop me from dating a person who has been labeled as a terrorist and had the opportunity to murder me, only being pulled back by another terrorist who experimented on human children. \n\nBut do you know what it did? It made me rethink whether the relationship was worth it. Naruto never saw accepted that Sasuke was a psychopath, whereas Sakura did. \n\n>Take just a few minutes to think about what would happen if Naruto said yes and the show just stopped there. I'm not talking about Sasuke or the war or anything other than Naruto and Sakura in a relationship.

If we are talking he never ends up with Hinata, and she never ends up with Sasuke, they'd probably still end up happy. Until the writing makes him call her on it, she could have been 100% truthful. She wouldn't be \"lying to herself\". Would Kishi have said that she was lying if he had believed her? The two of them had many moments throughout Shippuden that showed that they would've worked together, much better than the ones they ended up with. They would've been fine, and Boruto might have never happened as Neji wouldn't have to die for Hinata and Naruto, and Sakura x Naruto would've had a different kid, more in line with Sarada since Sakura is much more hands on in parenting than Hinata seems to be. \n\n\n>It's obvious that you've never been emotionally manipulated, because if you have, you would never defend what she did.\n\nLOL yes, I've never been emotionally manipulated. That isn't what happened when I was 17 with an overjealous \"friend\" and \"best friend\" to my then girlfriend.\n\nYou clearly don't understand the process of writing. Would she have been lying if he didn't call her on it? If anything, he'd be just as bad, as he was only interested in Sakura because he was jealous of Sakura and wanted what she had. Which he grows out of in Shippuden, but they had connected in multiple ways, where she completely trusts Naruto, and Naruto completely trusts basically everyone, so no issue there.",

I know that he spared him because he didn't want to kill his friend and submit to Itachi's will. How about you \"Watch it again on NarutoGet\".

She's useless. She didn't teach anyone anything to help them be better. She didn't help anyone grow. Not even to the supporting characters. You only see this in Boruto 1 time when she's training with Sasuke's daughter. But that's it. \n\n\n>he didn't want to kill his friend\n\nYeah that's what I said dummy \ud83e\udd23",

He said he wouldn't rely on Kyubi's powers and gave his words and he never goes back on his words cuz thats his nindo but he broke his nindo for Hinata. Blood Oath from chunin exams bruh. In manga he circled around Hinata's body to attack Pain (why didnt he just went over Hinata's body and instead circled around her?) and when he saw her saying Naruto he got more angry at Pain and then made a Bijudama to launch at Pain.\n\nIts not even true lmao, the movie's production began way before Naruto's ending, thats the reason why u dont see Naruto in his SPSM cloak, Sasuke is seen without his Rinnegan in one of the movie shots and Hinata doesnt use any of her jutsus from War Arc. Movie was already planned. And its the K12 couple which makes the most sense canonically (not including fillers) and Naruto just needed to remember her confession which he forcefully had to forget bcz of Kyubi transformation.",

She said she started changing after Naruto cheered for her and during her match with Neji said she wont run away anymore. And those changes are visible, she didnt run away from Pain even tho she knew she wont excel. She trained very hard and mastered TLF, was equal to Neji in War Arc and even saved him from a White Zetsu, both her and Neji's Air Palms were equal and so they were able to combine both Air Palms to make Air Wall Palm. She also the only Hyuga to make a variation to 64 palms by combining TLF and 64 palms, even Neji wasnt able to do that.",

Who she is and how she acts do not change at all throughout the story until the 3rd time Skip. From chapter 1 to chapter 700 she never becomes more than a shy girl who loves Naruto. Like I said there was a lot of potential w her back story and exploring her life in her sisters shadow, but she had so little screen time that it\u2019s never explored or fleshed out. We don\u2019t actually see her training or working hard or changing the hyuga plan. She says that\u2019s what she wants to do and then one day during the war arc we find out she did it",

I know that\u2019s confusing because her hair pin bits definitely have their own personality so it appears more like she is summoning others to do it for her but it is directly her power.\n\nFrom beginning of the manga till the end she goes from a shy quirky damaged girl who hides her pain behind a cheery voice and lots of smiles to someone who refuses to lose anyone else in her life and heals and helps friend and foe alike. And believes in herself and her friends to the point of being able to reject god himself\n\nShe learns through her intense experiences and the intense people in her life good or bad that hiding your emotions behind either fake happiness or indifference or just coldness to the world is a weakness that puts irreparable rifts between people that in the end could have related to each other.  You could see this with ulquiorra and herself and with shunsui and stark or ichigo and aizen \n\nA lot of the characters in bleach gain more power and more self confidence (which belief in yourself and your abilities and your friends effects characters strengths hugely in bleach) from facing their feelings and emotions and learning to express them.\n\nBut all of this development like I said isn\u2019t spoon fed to you like a lot of mangas like to do.  \n\nI\u2019d say she could have gotten more development yes but that\u2019s a bit specific to her and not to all the women in bleach.  Lots of the other women in bleach are powerful and deep and have a lot going on with them.  \n\nI\u2019d chalk this up to Kubos biggest problem is not that he is a bad writer but that he is a great writer that has a hard time showing you what he is doing when it is subtle.  It takes a few rereads through to pick up all this stuff and so bleach on the scale of anime and manga suffers because most aren\u2019t willing to put in the time to actually pick up all the details on what he is doing and how well laid out his stories are.  \n\nIf everyone took the time to really read deeply into what they saw in bleach I feel a lot more people would have it in their top ten of all time",

I concede that she has more character development than I give her credit for. \n\n> Lots of the other women in bleach are powerful and deep and have a lot going on with them. \n\nDo you feel that the character development of the women is comparable to that of the men in A) Bleach and B) most other manga series? \n\nI'm not saying that the women in manga get *no* development, but I wouldn't say it's comparable to the way the male characters get treated. I'd say this for both Bleach and most other manga. I know that the market is aimed at young men, but that doesn't mean there needs to be such a disparity between the genders. \n\nTo be fair to Japan, women have historically been underrepresented and used as props for male development in most western media too. It's only within the last few decades that western media has improved in terms of representation and breaking traditional gender roles. \n\nI know we got off a tangent on Bleach, but it holds true for Naruto too. And don't get me wrong, I love Naruto (and Bleach), but we can still point out the faults in the things we love (and some might say we should criticize media that we love because we want it to be better).",

Decent fight against Sasori considering she's just a chunin and with his grandma, knowing that one Akatsuki can usually wreck havoc in a village on his own (Hidan, much less, they'd attack him from afar after a while)? Turn out he's secretly suicidal (orphan or not, it's really cheap, it obviously shaped him, but it was an unnecessary conclusion).\n\nMaking a character fail or get foiled while still looking competent isn't even hard, but it's pretty clear Kishimoto didn't think things through considering all the pieces were there for Sakura to \"bag and drag\" (more like \"drag and drop\") this task like a pro, but I'll give that to you, he (almost(?)) always goes for the unnecessary drama when it comes to her decision making in critical moments.",

The only thing you can say about Hinata and Naruto's relationship is their is not enough romance for your liking, not bad romance, her fight against Neji or her stepping up to Pain is not bad romance. Sakura's corny lines about her being ready to leave the village for Sasuke is what I would call bad romance, because it was build from a superficial reason like his looks, not a good enough reason to leave your parents over a boy for something like that. That's like saying Dark is a bad show for not having enough romance or Berserk is bad because of less comedy, when other web series or Seinen have them. Something being in less amount doesn't equates it to being \"bad\" or poorly written when it is barely written by the writer in the first place.",

She loved Naruto, and he loved her, but they weren't \"in love\" with each other at this point.\n\nRegardless of the official translation, even if she just said \"suki da yo\" or \"daisuki\" or any other word that means like or love in Japanese it doesn't matter. She was framing that as a love confession. She was lying to Naruto to try and stop him. It was 100% emotional manipulation. She wasn't saying that she loved him in a platonic way because that would mean absolutely nothing in the story. That wouldn't have stopped him. Sakura was willing to go back to the village with Naruto and try to forget about Sasuke. That is bad on both sides, and neither of them would have ended up happy. Stop defending this point because there is no good side to it. It doesn't matter that they're 15, it doesn't matter that there's platonic love, what she did was horrible. I think I've argued with you about this before because this sounds like the same argument I had with someone on here.\n\nSo let me ask you this. Put yourself in Naruto's shoes.

I have had a relationship FUCKING END because someone's jealousy towards her friend/my girlfriend was used to break us up. Naruto did the right thing for calling her on it, which isn't the argument. But you know what wasn't a factor in it? The jealous \"friend\" wasn't trying to stop me from dating a person who has been labeled as a terrorist and had the opportunity to murder me, only being pulled back by another terrorist who experimented on human children. \n\nBut do you know what it did? It made me rethink whether the relationship was worth it. Naruto never saw accepted that Sasuke was a psychopath, whereas Sakura did. \n\n>Take just a few minutes to think about what would happen if Naruto said yes and the show just stopped there. I'm not talking about Sasuke or the war or anything other than Naruto and Sakura in a relationship. Do you honestly think that would have worked with her \"confession\" being the catalyst. \n\nThe show wouldn't end based off a relationship. If we are talking he never ends up with Hinata, and she never ends up with Sasuke, they'd probably still end up happy. Until the writing makes him call her on it, she could have been 100% truthful. She wouldn't be \"lying to herself\". Would Kishi have said that she was lying if he had believed her? The two of them had many moments throughout Shippuden that showed that they would've worked together, much better than the ones they ended up with. They would've been fine, and Boruto might have never happened as Neji wouldn't have to die for Hinata and Naruto, and Sakura x Naruto would've had a different kid, more in line with Sarada since Sakura is much more hands on in parenting than Hinata seems to be. \n\n\n>It's obvious that you've never been emotionally manipulated, because if you have, you would never defend what she did.\n\nLOL yes, I've never been emotionally manipulated. That isn't what happened when I was 17 with an overjealous \"friend\" and \"best friend\" to my then girlfriend.\n\nYou clearly don't understand the process of writing. Would she have been lying if he didn't call her on it? If anything, he'd be just as bad, as he was only interested in Sakura because he was jealous of Sakura and wanted what she had. Which he grows out of in Shippuden, but they had connected in multiple ways, where she completely trusts Naruto, and Naruto completely trusts basically everyone, so no issue there.",

She said she started changing after Naruto cheered for her and during her match with Neji said she wont run away anymore. And those changes are visible, she didnt run away from Pain even tho she knew she wont excel. She trained very hard and mastered TLF, was equal to Neji in War Arc and even saved him from a White Zetsu, both her and Neji's Air Palms were equal and so they were able to combine both Air Palms to make Air Wall Palm. She also the only Hyuga to make a variation to 64 palms by combining TLF and 64 palms, even Neji wasnt able to do that.",

Who she is and how she acts do not change at all throughout the story until the 3rd time Skip. From chapter 1 to chapter 700 she never becomes more than a shy girl who loves Naruto. Like I said there was a lot of potential w her back story and exploring her life in her sisters shadow, but she had so little screen time that it\u2019s never explored or fleshed out. We don\u2019t actually see her training or working hard or changing the hyuga plan. She says that\u2019s what she wants to do and then one day during the war arc we find out she did it",

I'd say this for both Bleach and most other manga. I know that the market is aimed at young men, but that doesn't mean there needs to be such a disparity between the genders. \n\nTo be fair to Japan, women have historically been underrepresented and used as props for male development in most western media too. It's only within the last few decades that western media has improved in terms of representation and breaking traditional gender roles. \n\nI know we got off a tangent on Bleach, but it holds true for Naruto too. And don't get me wrong, I love Naruto (and Bleach), but we can still point out the faults in the things we love (and some might say we should criticize media that we love because we want it to be better).",

The only thing you can say about Hinata and Naruto's relationship is their is not enough romance for your liking, not bad romance, her fight against Neji or her stepping up to Pain is not bad romance. Sakura's corny lines about her being ready to leave the village for Sasuke is what I would call bad romance, because it was build from a superficial reason like his looks, not a good enough reason to leave your parents over a boy for something like that. That's like saying Dark is a bad show for not having enough romance or Berserk is bad because of less comedy, when other web series or Seinen have them. Something being in less amount doesn't equates it to being \"bad\" or poorly written when it is barely written by the writer in the first place.",

Would you just blindly accept that? What if you did and the whole thing turned out to be a sham? How would that make you feel? Would you think that false relationship would have been worth it?\n\nI have been told that someone close liked me because she didn't like me having eyes for anyone else, and I called them on it, despite liking them as well once upon a time. I have had a relationship FUCKING END because someone's jealousy towards her friend/my girlfriend was used to break us up. Naruto did the right thing for calling her on it, which isn't the argument. But you know what wasn't a factor in it? The jealous \"friend\" wasn't trying to stop me from dating a person who has been labeled as a terrorist and had the opportunity to murder me, only being pulled back by another terrorist who experimented on human children. \n\nBut do you know what it did? It made me rethink whether the relationship was worth it. Naruto never saw accepted that Sasuke was a psychopath, whereas Sakura did. \n\n>Take just a few minutes to think about what would happen if Naruto said yes and the show just stopped there. I'm not talking about Sasuke or the war or anything other than Naruto and Sakura in a relationship. Do you honestly think that would have worked with her \"confession\" being the catalyst. \n\nThe show wouldn't end based off a relationship. If we are talking he never ends up with Hinata, and she never ends up with Sasuke, they'd probably still end up happy. Until the writing makes him call her on it, she could have been 100% truthful. She wouldn't be \"lying to herself\". Would Kishi have said that she was lying if he had believed her? The two of them had many moments throughout Shippuden that showed that they would've worked together, much better than the ones they ended up with. They would've been fine, and Boruto might have never happened as Neji wouldn't have to die for Hinata and Naruto, and Sakura x Naruto would've had a different kid, more in line with Sarada since Sakura is much more hands on in parenting than Hinata seems to be. \n\n\n>It's obvious that you've never been emotionally manipulated, because if you have, you would never defend what she did.\n\nLOL yes, I've never been emotionally manipulated. That isn't what happened when I was 17 with an overjealous \"friend\" and \"best friend\" to my then girlfriend.\n\nYou clearly don't understand the process of writing. Would she have been lying if he didn't call her on it? If anything, he'd be just as bad, as he was only interested in Sakura because he was jealous of Sakura and wanted what she had. Which he grows out of in Shippuden, but they had connected in multiple ways, where she completely trusts Naruto, and Naruto completely trusts basically everyone, so no issue there.",

Who she is and how she acts do not change at all throughout the story until the 3rd time Skip. From chapter 1 to chapter 700 she never becomes more than a shy girl who loves Naruto. Like I said there was a lot of potential w her back story and exploring her life in her sisters shadow, but she had so little screen time that it\u2019s never explored or fleshed out. We don\u2019t actually see her training or working hard or changing the hyuga plan. She says that\u2019s what she wants to do and then one day during the war arc we find out she did it",

Iruka is a one dimensional character, Pitou is one dimensional, so is Konohamaru. But none of them are bad characters because they serve their purpose well in the story. \n\n\n>It\u2019s ok to accept Naruto despite all its flaws I do too but to say the flaws don\u2019t matter because it\u2019s a battle Shonen is lazy\n\nHow is less romance a \"flaw\"? The only thing you can say about Hinata and Naruto's relationship is their is not enough romance for your liking, not bad romance, her fight against Neji or her stepping up to Pain is not bad romance. Sakura's corny lines about her being ready to leave the village for Sasuke is what I would call bad romance, because it was build from a superficial reason like his looks, not a good enough reason to leave your parents over a boy for something like that. That's like saying Dark is a bad show for not having enough romance or Berserk is bad because of less comedy, when other web series or Seinen have them. Something being in less amount doesn't equates it to being \"bad\" or poorly written when it is barely written by the writer in the first place.",

She's useless. She didn't teach anyone anything to help them be better. She didn't help anyone grow. Not even to the supporting characters.
