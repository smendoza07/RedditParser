    "body": "So. I've been pushing my SD to get a pet before I've gone off to med school in another country. \n\n# He works 3 days a week, has a huge empty house and is lonely. He denies he wants a pet but he misses his Divorce Dog...so...  i've been suggesting absolutely [insane](https://www.reddit.com/r/madlads/) pet ideas. \n\nI've been pushing for a capybara, wallaby, and a pig. \n\nMostly pigs. Like every time I spend the night, I wake him up with a [piglet video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbaIfdEAkII). \n\nEating breakfast? [Piglet Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80Ey06g5VIE) \n\nThis has been going on for weeks,\n\n**He has specifically said he doesn't think he wants a pig. At all.** \n\nI can't drop it.  He enjoys the piglet videos. And I enjoy that he secretly enjoys these piglet videos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work as a coordinator on a few organic farms.  I found out we're getting a wild hog rescue piglet today. \n\nPerfect serendipity. \n\nPrank ensues. I told him I got him a present. He's gonna love it. \n\n[Do you like her?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdwLXC370cg)  \"She's a feral hog.\" \\*Typing bubbles that last for a very long time and then disappear\\*: \n\n\"As an animal. Yes. As a potential pet... mostly no\" \n\nlol. So polite. \n\nI tell him  \\*well it's too late.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI already got her. I got her all of the vaccinations and wellness checks. I tell him that she's gonna need extra care  due to the fact that her snout was damaged when she was hit by a car. So she breathes extra loud and has sleep apnea. \n\n\"Can we set her free in the forest?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNope, too late. She needs people now. She's been domesticated. Trusts humans too much. She's just a baby. She's also litterbox trained. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sent him her vaccination records and x-rays. Told him she needed to be registered in the county as an 'exotic pet' due to zoning codes, and that \"i registered your name and address already, so if she goes missing they can contact you. So it's really too late now, you're completely legally responsible for her\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's freaking out, asking weird questions like \"does it eat cereal?\" and how big she's gonna get and if she can be crate trained.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLmao. \n\n\"Happy early christmas! You're gonna have such a blast when she's [older](https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/170426-wild-boars-fight-isis-feature.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1) and you can take her for walks!\" \n\nHe didn't text me for a while. \n\nI got busy with transporting the piglet and before I could call him to tell him I was joshin'. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe was at the fucking feed store getting pig supplies, asking for the address to pick her up, and list of medications she needed, where her litterbox was going. He was suddenly completely on board.  \n\nI told him I was joking, and that no, I didn't get him a fucking feral hog to keep in his gated community. \n\nAnd he was kind of.. sad. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, we're going to the dog shelter this weekend lol. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\njust wanted to share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",
