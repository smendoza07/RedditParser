Guests on other variety shows but hasn't recently shown interest in doing more.  She could also lack the opportunity but my gut feeling is its both.\n\nJSM needs the visibility, and while she is right now known for RM, she is following the LKS footsteps and taking this popularity and growing more from it.  Where as LKS didn't really do other variety (Busted is only one I know of and that felt like a Netflix throws money thing).  JSM on the other hand looks solidly down the variety route (she has done michuri and now sixth sense with YJS).",

A lot of viewers, guests, and even the Running Man members have said, that Suk Jin is having his heyday these days. And that's totally true! Suk Jin is the most outstanding member currently. He's the funniest and shines the most in  almost every episode now, super consistently. He's the most important member imo, arguably besides the main MC.\n\nAlso, Suk Jin is not starting out his career in his 20s or 30s and taking up any offers he gets. He's very different from Jae Suk (who works way too hard and doesn't have much time for his family). Suk Jin treasures work-life balance much more and he would have turned down offers to be a \"Regular\" without you knowing obviously (being a \"Regular\" means much more commitment than being a guest). He's done way too many shows the past 3 decades, and now he wants to have time to pursue other things like singing too.\n\nHe is one of the most well-respected entertainers in Korea, and a top-notch host and comedian. It is more likely that he's turning down a lot of offers to be a \"Regular\" on shows that he's not super interested in. This year he's going to be a cast member on \"A Leader's Day\" and it's one of the offers he took up because he has great personal interest in it (about business etc). So please don't assume that just because he doesn't take up as many offers means he doesn't get any offers at all, it's pretty disrespectful and very untrue.",

Anyway, my point is that for someone his age and at that stage of career, plus his values of work-life balance, he does not take up \"Regular\" role offers easily. It has to be something he is very interested in, otherwise he won't. He did take several shows (as you can see in the list) but they aren't long-running like Running Man. Yet, just because he has only one long-running regular show, you said \"There isn't a show that is interested in having him as a regular\" which is certainly untrue, and very disrespectful to him too. I hope you get what I'm trying to say. And more importantly, the proof of him being very, very, outstanding in Running Man should be drawn from his performance in Running Man, not from seeing how many shows he chooses to be on as a guest or Regular. Thankfully, he's been deservedly recognised by Running Man's viewers and fans, and getting loads of compliments and love. He's also been super hilarious on all the other shows he's appeared in, and getting the compliments there too. It's okay if you can't/didn't see it, millions of others appreciate and love him just like I do :)\n\nBy the way, he is planning to release a new album, and that is also one of the reasons why he is not going to be so active in Regular roles. He wants to be a singer as much as an entertainer.\n\nSource: [https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A7%80%EC%84%9D%EC%A7%84#%ED%98%84%EC%9E%AC\\_%EC%B6%9C%EC%97%B0\\_%EC%A4%91%EC%9D%B8\\_%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A7%80%EC%84%9D%EC%A7%84#%ED%98%84%EC%9E%AC_%EC%B6%9C%EC%97%B0_%EC%A4%91%EC%9D%B8_%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8)",

The fact that you said \u201che doesn\u2019t have the capability anymore\u201d in 2021 when he\u2019s being funnier than ever before and getting the most praises from literally everyone (to the point where lots of people were hoping for him to get Daesang the past 2 years), is totally mind-boggling. Even the recent guest\u2019s agency manager told her to stick close to Suk Jin because \u201che\u2019s trending these days\u201d.\n\nAnyway, the proof of him being very, very, outstanding in Running Man should be drawn from his performance in Running Man, not from seeing how many shows he chooses to be on as a guest or Regular. Thankfully, he's been deservedly recognised by Running Man's viewers and fans, and getting loads of compliments and love. He's also been super hilarious on all the other shows he's appeared in, and getting the compliments there too. It's okay if you can't/didn't see it, millions of others appreciate and love him just like I do :)",

Unlike Gary who seemed to want a clean break/fresh start from everything for his family, I don't think LKS will go the same route, and will (hopefully) keep in touch with the others.\n\nHe's a great actor and overall personality, so I look forward to seeing his future endeavors outside of Running Man. In his personal life, I wish him all the best with his girlfriend. I really love them together and am silently rooting for them. As someone who has been in PT for over a year, I know how mentally taxing rehabilitation can be when you can't do everything you want to, so I can't imagine the mental burden he's been carrying around.\n\nPersonally, I feel like this is going to be the beginning of the end, not necessarily that I think it's a bad thing. The show has had a great run, and whatever the cast and crew's decision is, I'll support it. They've given me so many great memories over the years, the least I can do is support them. On a more general note, as I work my way through my early 20s, it's hard not to feel like so many things are shifting. Nothing but the curse of time I guess ://",

The production team and the cast also respected Lee Kwang-soo's will. In the future, \"Running Man\" will be continued by seven cast members, excluding Lee Kwang-soo.\n\nLee Kwang-soo spent more than 3,000 days together on \"Running Man,\" which first aired in July 2010, and was loved by many viewers for his pleasant talk and boldness not to be afraid to ruin. Except when Lee Kwang-soo was away for about a month due to a traffic accident in January last year, he appeared sincerely and smiled every Sunday.\n\nAs \"Running Man\" gained popularity not only in Korea but also throughout Asia, Lee Kwang-soo was called \"Asia Prince\" and enjoyed a thick overseas fandom. Whenever \"Running Man\" traveled all over Asia for special broadcasts and performances, it was able to get a glimpse of Lee Kwang-soo Lee's hot popularity.\"\n\nSource: http://m.joynews24.com/v/1361909#_DYAD\n\nHis agency also made a statement, so it's official. \nLet's pray for his recovery and that he never feel guilty or responsible for choosing his health. That's what's most important. \n\nEdit: why you guys downvoting me? It's just a matter of time before you hear the news from more outlets... I'm just posting it so that i post also the translation, which can help at least understand the whole situation...",

I do believe it\u2019s time for him to move on however why does it still feel so devastating:( like another era of running man has ended. I\u2019m fairly new to RM I started watching in 2018 and I\u2019ve been watching every week since so it\u2019s gonna be sad to see it change I feel as if this is how og viewers felt when Gary left so now I finally understand. I think the cast is capable of filling in his position and keeping the show going but I will always miss his goofs. I hope they don\u2019t try to add a new member and just let the members they have continue with the show as is, I will continue to support them and running man as long as it lasts!",

I guess you could say he's been my favorite. With a show that has had so few cast changes compared to some other variety programs, this one is really big. I hope RM can continue but this is going to change dynamics a lot. JSM draws some of the same attention (has the reputation for being weird, has others scold her, gets accused of betraying), but man, his absence is going to be felt hard. This could be what leads to the reset they avoided when KJK and SJH stayed, and I would not look forward to that. I always though that if they ever did that, LKS would stick around as one of the veterans. I'm worried the end is going to come for RM this time.",

He's always fighting for the prize 100% even if the chances are high that he'd be penalize. He was always ride or die. And because of his loyalty and focus for acting, he's been exclusive to RM.

His presence is felt throughout the span of the show; remember when he was absent for 2 episodes and how the other members begged for him to come back asap? His impact on the show has been legendary to say the least. I really do hope that he reconsiders, maybe take a leave for a year or so to recover and restabilize his health? But of course, the decision is all up to him, I do wish him all the best in his future endeavors, wherever that may be. I hope he knows that he's well loved by the RM community around the world and that he'll always have the RM family by his side.\n\np.s if YJS decides to leave next, it's game over for RM \ud83d\ude2d",

Until then, I will still actively support Running Man every week as well as LKS dramas and movies.\n\nI hope that Running Man will still show us cool concepts every week despite the absence of LKS. I believe that Bopil PD and the rest of the cast will still show us funny and entertaining episodes every week.\n\nI guess I will binge watch all Running Man episodes after the broadcast of his last episode. \ud83d\ude2d",

Both Inseparable Brothers and Collective Invention take on serious themes as well. Running Man likes to joke Collective Invention because Lee Kwangsoo becomes a literal fish, but it's actually a deep and thoughtful commentary on today's society. The ending really makes you reflect.\n\nOf course, he also has the more fun roles and cameos, but I find that every role he takes is different, and he takes on characters and adds color to them. His character in It's Okay, That's Love could've easily been an offensive caricature of someone with a disability, but he portrayed that character with dignity and depth.\n\nAgain, RM likes to joke Kwangsoo's acting, like him winning the Baeksang Award for Best Supporting Actor, but Actor Kwangsoo is actually really good. I imagine his acting career can grow more now that people will be hungry for his content, and he won't have to have Mondays for RM filming anymore.",

In my opinion he was really good in Confession, that was the one that made me realize LKS is a good actor. Imo, his acting on Tazza was good too, as the character showed expressions that we've not seen weekly on RM. \n\nWith other characters he played, I often saw the same facial expressions that I see weekly on RM and couldn't shake off that variety personality of his, even when the role was serious like Inseparable Bros. \n\nI like LKS and I hope he gets more roles different from his usual self so that more ppl will know he can act well. Hence I support his move to leave RM, I think it will do good for his acting career.",

Instead, the crew will likely just try to replace them or reboot the show. It just depends on the reboot is received (possibly it might have a better reception than last time if the members leave willingly).\n\nIf I'm being honest, Running Man has always been one of my favorite shows but in recent years it's gotten dull. With the members being older, their bodies can't keep up with as physical activities as they used to. But there's only so many non-physical games and activities they can do before the show gets boring.",

However, it is better to see him leave than not seeing him anymore in any other shows/movies just because his condition worsened. We will definitely miss him in RM because we are used to seeing his humorous act every week, but, at the same time I am happy because he ones chose his own health (although, this could be the hardest decision he has ever made-can't just imagine how broke he was when he came to this decision), so, I hope that he fully recover so we could see him again on the screen (might it be small/big screens). \n\nBtw, 11 years is no joke, that is more than a decade of giving his best for the show. And just as SBS mentioned, he did all the hardwork, because he love the show so much (RM members can testify to that). We have seen how dedicated he was even after his injury. He is just so professional in everything he do, taking note that he is opposite of what he is in RM. So, he sacrificed for 11 years just to entertain us and even go beyond our expectations. I just love him. Nonetheless, I will keep on supporting RM (the second home of LKS). \n\nThough he is leaving RM, this also opens a great opportunity for him to showcase his great acting and an opportunity for us to see more of ACTOR LKS which I adore even better. If you have watched some of his dramas and movies, you will be amazed on how talented LKS is especially when releasing his emotion in a scene. He is such a multi-talented person and I am excited to see more of him as an actor. But, for now, let us just hope that he fully recovers with a bright smile. Let us keep on supporting LKS and RM. \ud83d\ude0a",

I'll still be watching to see how new episodes without him turn out, but I wouldn't be surprised if the quality went down, or others left, or the show got cancelled altogether.

And yeah, I\u2019m concerned for the future of the show. He has a huge presence and while the episode or two he missed for the original injury were funny enough, they weren\u2019t as good as they would have been. That and they brought him back with the cast still on, which meant to me that the cast and crew understood how important he was as well. Bottom line is, Running Man will have to end one day, and I think KwangSoo\u2019s departure will be the beginning of that. Hope it doesn\u2019t weigh on him too hard.

SJH is of a higher tier (though not highest), and so should really think of them as two very different situations.\n\nSJH is in many ways past her prime earnings already (she now plays Moms).  Guests on other variety shows but hasn't recently shown interest in doing more.  She could also lack the opportunity but my gut feeling is its both.\n\nJSM needs the visibility, and while she is right now known for RM, she is following the LKS footsteps and taking this popularity and growing more from it.  Where as LKS didn't really do other variety (Busted is only one I know of and that felt like a Netflix throws money thing).  JSM on the other hand looks solidly down the variety route (she has done michuri and now sixth sense with YJS).",

A lot of viewers, guests, and even the Running Man members have said, that Suk Jin is having his heyday these days. And that's totally true! Suk Jin is the most outstanding member currently. He's the funniest and shines the most in  almost every episode now, super consistently. He's the most important member imo, arguably besides the main MC.\n\nAlso, Suk Jin is not starting out his career in his 20s or 30s and taking up any offers he gets. He's very different from Jae Suk (who works way too hard and doesn't have much time for his family). Suk Jin treasures work-life balance much more and he would have turned down offers to be a \"Regular\" without you knowing obviously (being a \"Regular\" means much more commitment than being a guest). He's done way too many shows the past 3 decades, and now he wants to have time to pursue other things like singing too.\n\nHe is one of the most well-respected entertainers in Korea, and a top-notch host and comedian. It is more likely that he's turning down a lot of offers to be a \"Regular\" on shows that he's not super interested in. This year he's going to be a cast member on \"A Leader's Day\" and it's one of the offers he took up because he has great personal interest in it (about business etc). So please don't assume that just because he doesn't take up as many offers means he doesn't get any offers at all, it's pretty disrespectful and very untrue.",

Anyway, my point is that for someone his age and at that stage of career, plus his values of work-life balance, he does not take up \"Regular\" role offers easily. It has to be something he is very interested in, otherwise he won't. He did take several shows (as you can see in the list) but they aren't long-running like Running Man. Yet, just because he has only one long-running regular show, you said \"There isn't a show that is interested in having him as a regular\" which is certainly untrue, and very disrespectful to him too. I hope you get what I'm trying to say. And more importantly, the proof of him being very, very, outstanding in Running Man should be drawn from his performance in Running Man, not from seeing how many shows he chooses to be on as a guest or Regular. Thankfully, he's been deservedly recognised by Running Man's viewers and fans, and getting loads of compliments and love. He's also been super hilarious on all the other shows he's appeared in, and getting the compliments there too. It's okay if you can't/didn't see it, millions of others appreciate and love him just like I do :)\n\nBy the way, he is planning to release a new album, and that is also one of the reasons why he is not going to be so active in Regular roles. He wants to be a singer as much as an entertainer.\n\nSource: [https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A7%80%EC%84%9D%EC%A7%84#%ED%98%84%EC%9E%AC\\_%EC%B6%9C%EC%97%B0\\_%EC%A4%91%EC%9D%B8\\_%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A7%80%EC%84%9D%EC%A7%84#%ED%98%84%EC%9E%AC_%EC%B6%9C%EC%97%B0_%EC%A4%91%EC%9D%B8_%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8)",

The fact that you said \u201che doesn\u2019t have the capability anymore\u201d in 2021 when he\u2019s being funnier than ever before and getting the most praises from literally everyone (to the point where lots of people were hoping for him to get Daesang the past 2 years), is totally mind-boggling. Even the recent guest\u2019s agency manager told her to stick close to Suk Jin because \u201che\u2019s trending these days\u201d.\n\nAnyway, the proof of him being very, very, outstanding in Running Man should be drawn from his performance in Running Man, not from seeing how many shows he chooses to be on as a guest or Regular. Thankfully, he's been deservedly recognised by Running Man's viewers and fans, and getting loads of compliments and love. He's also been super hilarious on all the other shows he's appeared in, and getting the compliments there too. It's okay if you can't/didn't see it, millions of others appreciate and love him just like I do :)",

Both Inseparable Brothers and Collective Invention take on serious themes as well. Running Man likes to joke Collective Invention because Lee Kwangsoo becomes a literal fish, but it's actually a deep and thoughtful commentary on today's society. The ending really makes you reflect.\n\nOf course, he also has the more fun roles and cameos, but I find that every role he takes is different, and he takes on characters and adds color to them. His character in It's Okay, That's Love could've easily been an offensive caricature of someone with a disability, but he portrayed that character with dignity and depth.\n\nAgain, RM likes to joke Kwangsoo's acting, like him winning the Baeksang Award for Best Supporting Actor, but Actor Kwangsoo is actually really good. I imagine his acting career can grow more now that people will be hungry for his content, and he won't have to have Mondays for RM filming anymore.",

In my opinion he was really good in Confession, that was the one that made me realize LKS is a good actor. Imo, his acting on Tazza was good too, as the character showed expressions that we've not seen weekly on RM. \n\nWith other characters he played, I often saw the same facial expressions that I see weekly on RM and couldn't shake off that variety personality of his, even when the role was serious like Inseparable Bros. \n\nI like LKS and I hope he gets more roles different from his usual self so that more ppl will know he can act well. Hence I support his move to leave RM, I think it will do good for his acting career.",

Her like Kwang Soo in part sticks to RM because its like a close knit group of friends and enjoys the time.\n\nSuk Jin, while wanting to do more variety, doesn't have the capability anymore.  There isn't a show that is interested in having him as a regular (as far as I can tell).\n\nAll the others are trying to do more variety shows, and are less likely to proactively give up one.

He's also killing it lately and getting tons of comments online and from guests about how funny he is (Brave Girls, Choa, etc). Combined with a lot more chit-chat and a lot fewer physical games it's a great platform for him to continue to stand out, which could open the door for him to possibly be in more shows in the future when Running Man finally ends, if he wants.",

He dont even need to continue his career and I do believe he just continue joining the show due to his passion for entertainment.\n\nThe one that affected the most if RM ends are, maybe SJH and JSM as RM is the only platform that they are famous for and their film/drama are not that well known in Korea except a few.\n\nP/s: Actually JSJ top youtube posts were about his tesla, car reviews, and among us. not related to RM at all + almost his short videos reach Million views.

SJH is of a higher tier (though not highest), and so should really think of them as two very different situations.\n\nSJH is in many ways past her prime earnings already (she now plays Moms).  Guests on other variety shows but hasn't recently shown interest in doing more.  She could also lack the opportunity but my gut feeling is its both.\n\nJSM needs the visibility, and while she is right now known for RM, she is following the LKS footsteps and taking this popularity and growing more from it.  Where as LKS didn't really do other variety (Busted is only one I know of and that felt like a Netflix throws money thing).  JSM on the other hand looks solidly down the variety route (she has done michuri and now sixth sense with YJS).",

A lot of viewers, guests, and even the Running Man members have said, that Suk Jin is having his heyday these days. And that's totally true! Suk Jin is the most outstanding member currently. He's the funniest and shines the most in  almost every episode now, super consistently. He's the most important member imo, arguably besides the main MC.\n\nAlso, Suk Jin is not starting out his career in his 20s or 30s and taking up any offers he gets. He's very different from Jae Suk (who works way too hard and doesn't have much time for his family). Suk Jin treasures work-life balance much more and he would have turned down offers to be a \"Regular\" without you knowing obviously (being a \"Regular\" means much more commitment than being a guest). He's done way too many shows the past 3 decades, and now he wants to have time to pursue other things like singing too.\n\nHe is one of the most well-respected entertainers in Korea, and a top-notch host and comedian. It is more likely that he's turning down a lot of offers to be a \"Regular\" on shows that he's not super interested in. This year he's going to be a cast member on \"A Leader's Day\" and it's one of the offers he took up because he has great personal interest in it (about business etc). So please don't assume that just because he doesn't take up as many offers means he doesn't get any offers at all, it's pretty disrespectful and very untrue.",

Anyway, my point is that for someone his age and at that stage of career, plus his values of work-life balance, he does not take up \"Regular\" role offers easily. It has to be something he is very interested in, otherwise he won't. He did take several shows (as you can see in the list) but they aren't long-running like Running Man. Yet, just because he has only one long-running regular show, you said \"There isn't a show that is interested in having him as a regular\" which is certainly untrue, and very disrespectful to him too. I hope you get what I'm trying to say. And more importantly, the proof of him being very, very, outstanding in Running Man should be drawn from his performance in Running Man, not from seeing how many shows he chooses to be on as a guest or Regular. Thankfully, he's been deservedly recognised by Running Man's viewers and fans, and getting loads of compliments and love. He's also been super hilarious on all the other shows he's appeared in, and getting the compliments there too. It's okay if you can't/didn't see it, millions of others appreciate and love him just like I do :)\n\nBy the way, he is planning to release a new album, and that is also one of the reasons why he is not going to be so active in Regular roles. He wants to be a singer as much as an entertainer.\n\nSource: [https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A7%80%EC%84%9D%EC%A7%84#%ED%98%84%EC%9E%AC\\_%EC%B6%9C%EC%97%B0\\_%EC%A4%91%EC%9D%B8\\_%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A7%80%EC%84%9D%EC%A7%84#%ED%98%84%EC%9E%AC_%EC%B6%9C%EC%97%B0_%EC%A4%91%EC%9D%B8_%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8)",

On his current shows, one is his own channel, one is a youtube show, and one is an advert...\n\nYou say \"work-life balance\", but where is data behind this statement?  He does less work than any of the other RM members (and I believe this has been true for the run of RM).\n\nYou say \"interested in\", but where is the data behind this statement?  What work has he been rumored to be associated with but then turned down?  \n\nYou are welcome to be a JSJ fan boy.  I think that is great.  He needs more fans.  Its possible to be a fan and still be realistic about a person though.",

The fact that you said \u201che doesn\u2019t have the capability anymore\u201d in 2021 when he\u2019s being funnier than ever before and getting the most praises from literally everyone (to the point where lots of people were hoping for him to get Daesang the past 2 years), is totally mind-boggling. Even the recent guest\u2019s agency manager told her to stick close to Suk Jin because \u201che\u2019s trending these days\u201d.\n\nAnyway, the proof of him being very, very, outstanding in Running Man should be drawn from his performance in Running Man, not from seeing how many shows he chooses to be on as a guest or Regular. Thankfully, he's been deservedly recognised by Running Man's viewers and fans, and getting loads of compliments and love. He's also been super hilarious on all the other shows he's appeared in, and getting the compliments there too.

Both Inseparable Brothers and Collective Invention take on serious themes as well. Running Man likes to joke Collective Invention because Lee Kwangsoo becomes a literal fish, but it's actually a deep and thoughtful commentary on today's society. The ending really makes you reflect.\n\nOf course, he also has the more fun roles and cameos, but I find that every role he takes is different, and he takes on characters and adds color to them. His character in It's Okay, That's Love could've easily been an offensive caricature of someone with a disability, but he portrayed that character with dignity and depth.\n\nAgain, RM likes to joke Kwangsoo's acting, like him winning the Baeksang Award for Best Supporting Actor, but Actor Kwangsoo is actually really good. I imagine his acting career can grow more now that people will be hungry for his content, and he won't have to have Mondays for RM filming anymore.",

In my opinion he was really good in Confession, that was the one that made me realize LKS is a good actor. Imo, his acting on Tazza was good too, as the character showed expressions that we've not seen weekly on RM. \n\nWith other characters he played, I often saw the same facial expressions that I see weekly on RM and couldn't shake off that variety personality of his, even when the role was serious like Inseparable Bros. \n\nI like LKS and I hope he gets more roles different from his usual self so that more ppl will know he can act well.

Guests on other variety shows but hasn't recently shown interest in doing more.  She could also lack the opportunity but my gut feeling is its both.\n\nJSM needs the visibility, and while she is right now known for RM, she is following the LKS footsteps and taking this popularity and growing more from it.  Where as LKS didn't really do other variety (Busted is only one I know of and that felt like a Netflix throws money thing).  JSM on the other hand looks solidly down the variety route (she has done michuri and now sixth sense with YJS).",

A lot of viewers, guests, and even the Running Man members have said, that Suk Jin is having his heyday these days. And that's totally true! Suk Jin is the most outstanding member currently. He's the funniest and shines the most in  almost every episode now, super consistently. He's the most important member imo, arguably besides the main MC.\n\nAlso, Suk Jin is not starting out his career in his 20s or 30s and taking up any offers he gets. He's very different from Jae Suk (who works way too hard and doesn't have much time for his family). Suk Jin treasures work-life balance much more and he would have turned down offers to be a \"Regular\" without you knowing obviously (being a \"Regular\" means much more commitment than being a guest). He's done way too many shows the past 3 decades, and now he wants to have time to pursue other things like singing too.\n\nHe is one of the most well-respected entertainers in Korea, and a top-notch host and comedian. It is more likely that he's turning down a lot of offers to be a \"Regular\" on shows that he's not super interested in. This year he's going to be a cast member on \"A Leader's Day\" and it's one of the offers he took up because he has great personal interest in it (about business etc). So please don't assume that just because he doesn't take up as many offers means he doesn't get any offers at all, it's pretty disrespectful and very untrue.",

Anyway, my point is that for someone his age and at that stage of career, plus his values of work-life balance, he does not take up \"Regular\" role offers easily. It has to be something he is very interested in, otherwise he won't. He did take several shows (as you can see in the list) but they aren't long-running like Running Man. Yet, just because he has only one long-running regular show, you said \"There isn't a show that is interested in having him as a regular\" which is certainly untrue, and very disrespectful to him too. I hope you get what I'm trying to say. And more importantly, the proof of him being very, very, outstanding in Running Man should be drawn from his performance in Running Man, not from seeing how many shows he chooses to be on as a guest or Regular. Thankfully, he's been deservedly recognised by Running Man's viewers and fans, and getting loads of compliments and love. He's also been super hilarious on all the other shows he's appeared in, and getting the compliments there too. It's okay if you can't/didn't see it, millions of others appreciate and love him just like I do :)\n\nBy the way, he is planning to release a new album, and that is also one of the reasons why he is not going to be so active in Regular roles. He wants to be a singer as much as an entertainer.\n\nSource: [https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A7%80%EC%84%9D%EC%A7%84#%ED%98%84%EC%9E%AC\\_%EC%B6%9C%EC%97%B0\\_%EC%A4%91%EC%9D%B8\\_%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A7%80%EC%84%9D%EC%A7%84#%ED%98%84%EC%9E%AC_%EC%B6%9C%EC%97%B0_%EC%A4%91%EC%9D%B8_%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8)",

Both Inseparable Brothers and Collective Invention take on serious themes as well. Running Man likes to joke Collective Invention because Lee Kwangsoo becomes a literal fish, but it's actually a deep and thoughtful commentary on today's society. The ending really makes you reflect.\n\nOf course, he also has the more fun roles and cameos, but I find that every role he takes is different, and he takes on characters and adds color to them. His character in It's Okay, That's Love could've easily been an offensive caricature of someone with a disability, but he portrayed that character with dignity and depth.\n\nAgain, RM likes to joke Kwangsoo's acting, like him winning the Baeksang Award for Best Supporting Actor, but Actor Kwangsoo is actually really good. I imagine his acting career can grow more now that people will be hungry for his content, and he won't have to have Mondays for RM filming anymore.",

Imo, his acting on Tazza was good too, as the character showed expressions that we've not seen weekly on RM. \n\nWith other characters he played, I often saw the same facial expressions that I see weekly on RM and couldn't shake off that variety personality of his, even when the role was serious like Inseparable Bros. \n\nI like LKS and I hope he gets more roles different from his usual self so that more ppl will know he can act well. Hence I support his move to leave RM, I think it will do good for his acting career.",

Entertainer at his age can retired anytime he wants. \n\nHe is stable financially. Plus, he owned a restaurant in China and active in other businesses. He dont even need to continue his career and I do believe he just continue joining the show due to his passion for entertainment.\n\nThe one that affected the most if RM ends are, maybe SJH and JSM as RM is the only platform that they are famous for and their film/drama are not that well known in Korea except a few.\n\nP/s: Actually JSJ top youtube posts were about his tesla, car reviews, and among us. not related to RM at all + almost his short videos reach Million views.

SJH is of a higher tier (though not highest), and so should really think of them as two very different situations.\n\nSJH is in many ways past her prime earnings already (she now plays Moms).  Guests on other variety shows but hasn't recently shown interest in doing more.  She could also lack the opportunity but my gut feeling is its both.\n\nJSM needs the visibility, and while she is right now known for RM, she is following the LKS footsteps and taking this popularity and growing more from it.  Where as LKS didn't really do other variety (Busted is only one I know of and that felt like a Netflix throws money thing).  JSM on the other hand looks solidly down the variety route (she has done michuri and now sixth sense with YJS).",

Anyway, my point is that for someone his age and at that stage of career, plus his values of work-life balance, he does not take up \"Regular\" role offers easily. It has to be something he is very interested in, otherwise he won't. He did take several shows (as you can see in the list) but they aren't long-running like Running Man. Yet, just because he has only one long-running regular show, you said \"There isn't a show that is interested in having him as a regular\" which is certainly untrue, and very disrespectful to him too. I hope you get what I'm trying to say. And more importantly, the proof of him being very, very, outstanding in Running Man should be drawn from his performance in Running Man, not from seeing how many shows he chooses to be on as a guest or Regular. Thankfully, he's been deservedly recognised by Running Man's viewers and fans, and getting loads of compliments and love. He's also been super hilarious on all the other shows he's appeared in, and getting the compliments there too. It's okay if you can't/didn't see it, millions of others appreciate and love him just like I do :)\n\nBy the way, he is planning to release a new album, and that is also one of the reasons why he is not going to be so active in Regular roles. He wants to be a singer as much as an entertainer.\n\nSource: [https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A7%80%EC%84%9D%EC%A7%84#%ED%98%84%EC%9E%AC\\_%EC%B6%9C%EC%97%B0\\_%EC%A4%91%EC%9D%B8\\_%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A7%80%EC%84%9D%EC%A7%84#%ED%98%84%EC%9E%AC_%EC%B6%9C%EC%97%B0_%EC%A4%91%EC%9D%B8_%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8)",

Imo, his acting on Tazza was good too, as the character showed expressions that we've not seen weekly on RM. \n\nWith other characters he played, I often saw the same facial expressions that I see weekly on RM and couldn't shake off that variety personality of his, even when the role was serious like Inseparable Bros. \n\nI like LKS and I hope he gets more roles different from his usual self so that more ppl will know he can act well. Hence I support his move to leave RM, I think it will do good for his acting career.",

SJH is of a higher tier (though not highest), and so should really think of them as two very different situations.\n\nSJH is in many ways past her prime earnings already (she now plays Moms).  Guests on other variety shows but hasn't recently shown interest in doing more.  She could also lack the opportunity but my gut feeling is its both.\n\nJSM needs the visibility, and while she is right now known for RM, she is following the LKS footsteps and taking this popularity and growing more from it.  Where as LKS didn't really do other variety (Busted is only one I know of and that felt like a Netflix throws money thing).  JSM on the other hand looks solidly down the variety route (she has done michuri and now sixth sense with YJS).",

Anyway, my point is that for someone his age and at that stage of career, plus his values of work-life balance, he does not take up \"Regular\" role offers easily. It has to be something he is very interested in, otherwise he won't. He did take several shows (as you can see in the list) but they aren't long-running like Running Man. Yet, just because he has only one long-running regular show, you said \"There isn't a show that is interested in having him as a regular\" which is certainly untrue, and very disrespectful to him too. I hope you get what I'm trying to say. And more importantly, the proof of him being very, very, outstanding in Running Man should be drawn from his performance in Running Man, not from seeing how many shows he chooses to be on as a guest or Regular. Thankfully, he's been deservedly recognised by Running Man's viewers and fans, and getting loads of compliments and love. He's also been super hilarious on all the other shows he's appeared in, and getting the compliments there too. It's okay if you can't/didn't see it, millions of others appreciate and love him just like I do :)\n\nBy the way, he is planning to release a new album, and that is also one of the reasons why he is not going to be so active in Regular roles. He wants to be a singer as much as an entertainer.\n\nSource: [https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A7%80%EC%84%9D%EC%A7%84#%ED%98%84%EC%9E%AC\\_%EC%B6%9C%EC%97%B0\\_%EC%A4%91%EC%9D%B8\\_%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A7%80%EC%84%9D%EC%A7%84#%ED%98%84%EC%9E%AC_%EC%B6%9C%EC%97%B0_%EC%A4%91%EC%9D%B8_%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8)",
