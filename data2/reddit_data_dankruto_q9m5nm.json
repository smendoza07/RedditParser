We have seen him get better at SM after that tho.",

In actuality naruto's chakra played the role of suppressing the 9 tails and stopping the 9 tails's chakra from leaking out they do not naturally mix in fact in the Chunin exams an issue with naruto was that the 5 pronged seal stopped him from suppressing the 9 tails and had his chakra mixed with the 9 tails which made him worse at using his own chakra because the nine tails doesn't bolster his chakra.",

The surrounding circumstance is Naruto using his chakra to make shadow clones to train, Kakashi saying to naruto just use the nine tails doesn't make sense seeing as he calls Yamato to suppress the nine tails it would just be a weird fact that doesn't help him. the translation I'm using is Hisshouburaiken translation you're using the Japflap ones I'm guessing. Kakashi does mention in the official viz media sub that he has significantly less chakra than Naruto so much less that he can't do an uneven chakra distribution or maintain shadow clones for long and it also says that if he didn't have to suppress the 9 tails he'd have 100x more. Get hulu and watch the Naruto shippuden sub. Further more Yamato backs Kakashi up by saying that since Naruto needs to use so much of his own chakra it makes his seal weaker, this is also why Kushina had issues with pregnancy",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

Meaning his sensory abilities are beyond Toad Sage Mode, not to mention that the form doesn't have a time limit due to the snake constantly gathering chakra. \n\nTheir fight was not your usual fight because, Sasuke had a goal to beat Kabuto without killing him, Itachi was trying to get him in a genjutsu. Kabuto in his hand had to fight blind while trying to take control of Itachi again and immobilizing Sasuke to take control of his body later down the like. None of the characters were fighting to kill. \n\nHe also have Manda 2.0, while Toads like Gamabunta are the size of a 2-3 story house, Manda 2.0 was bigger than turtle island. He did all of that while controlling a bunch of zombies far away from the battlefield. \n\nIf he can fight basically prodigious 2 EMS users at the same thing, then he can fight one Sage Mode user.",

When Naruto used baryon, all of Kurama was burnt out, and the volume decreased. So no, Kurama never permanently added Chakra to Naruto's Chakra pool, he was just an addition to it, and as Naruto gained more control over his Chakra, he was able to use it more efficiently and as he befriended Kurama, he was able to pull from both sides whenever needed.\n\n(yes, I know water is heavier than oil, and tailed beast Chakra is supposed to be \"heavy\", but it's a metaphor)",

Sasuke didn't just lose his Rinnegan... he lost his Rinnegan ***and*** one Sharingan, because his left eye was a 2-in-1. But one eternal mangekyou should still be enough to keep him up to par with Naruto's frog sage mode and large Uzumaki-chakra reserves.\n\nWith Just one sharingan and frog sage mode respectively, Naruto and Sasuke are now probably weaker than Hashirama and Madara when they were alive. Since I don't think Naruto has quite as much chakra as Hashirama,  and regardless, his sage mode is definitely not as good, and wood style hax is self-explanatory... and being downgraded to just 1 EMS definitely puts Sasuke below Madara's double EMS.",

Sasuke as an adult is at least that skilled, I think. And if anything, I feel like Naruto without Kurama no longer has any techniques that enable him to take on large scale attacks like wood style or perfect susanoo, which are arguably the primary techniques that put Madara and Hashirama in a league of their own. Back in the war, even Madara's basic Susanoo has proven too powerful for regular sage mode Naruto to even dent. At this point, I'm banking on Sasuke having the greatest destructive potential of the two solely because of Susanoo, *if* he can still use it with one eye, like Madara does blind.",

You could argue that sasuke has a greater iq and battle tactics beyond his ems, making him formidable, but Naruto has been able to outsmart and execute well orchestrated plans throughout the later end of shippuden and during the war arc. Sure he utilized kuramas chakra a lot, but most importantly, he excelled with what he had, and I\u2019m sure he can still do the same without him. So yeah don\u2019t sleep on that homie.",

He never has chakra and always needs Kurama, even to make an actual functioning shadow clone because apparently he\u2019s so overworked he can\u2019t make any. He\u2019ll probably be useless the next time an Otsutuki shows up and if his \u201cout of chakra\u201d restraint isn\u2019t removed, he\u2019ll probably be useless against any other S ranked shinobi.",

Anime atleast. \n\nBut ye i hate boruto, but kawaki isn't mc potential for the Naruto franchise. Hes too emo, and fits as a side character.",

In actuality naruto's chakra played the role of suppressing the 9 tails and stopping the 9 tails's chakra from leaking out they do not naturally mix in fact in the Chunin exams an issue with naruto was that the 5 pronged seal stopped him from suppressing the 9 tails and had his chakra mixed with the 9 tails which made him worse at using his own chakra because the nine tails doesn't bolster his chakra.",

The surrounding circumstance is Naruto using his chakra to make shadow clones to train, Kakashi saying to naruto just use the nine tails doesn't make sense seeing as he calls Yamato to suppress the nine tails it would just be a weird fact that doesn't help him. the translation I'm using is Hisshouburaiken translation you're using the Japflap ones I'm guessing. Kakashi does mention in the official viz media sub that he has significantly less chakra than Naruto so much less that he can't do an uneven chakra distribution or maintain shadow clones for long and it also says that if he didn't have to suppress the 9 tails he'd have 100x more. Get hulu and watch the Naruto shippuden sub. Further more Yamato backs Kakashi up by saying that since Naruto needs to use so much of his own chakra it makes his seal weaker, this is also why Kushina had issues with pregnancy",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

Its also stated that when naruto is putting immense physical strain on his body it increases the chance the 9 tails can break out. Nothing to with Chakra.

Meaning his sensory abilities are beyond Toad Sage Mode, not to mention that the form doesn't have a time limit due to the snake constantly gathering chakra. \n\nTheir fight was not your usual fight because, Sasuke had a goal to beat Kabuto without killing him, Itachi was trying to get him in a genjutsu. Kabuto in his hand had to fight blind while trying to take control of Itachi again and immobilizing Sasuke to take control of his body later down the like. None of the characters were fighting to kill. \n\nHe also have Manda 2.0, while Toads like Gamabunta are the size of a 2-3 story house, Manda 2.0 was bigger than turtle island. He did all of that while controlling a bunch of zombies far away from the battlefield. \n\nIf he can fight basically prodigious 2 EMS users at the same thing, then he can fight one Sage Mode user.",

            "body": ">i think losing kurama is worse that losing a renigan\n\nI think Naruto and Sasuke actually lost a fairly equivalent amount of their power. Sasuke didn't just lose his Rinnegan... he lost his Rinnegan ***and*** one Sharingan, because his left eye was a 2-in-1. But one eternal mangekyou should still be enough to keep him up to par with Naruto's frog sage mode and large Uzumaki-chakra reserves.\n\nWith Just one sharingan and frog sage mode respectively, Naruto and Sasuke are now probably weaker than Hashirama and Madara when they were alive. Since I don't think Naruto has quite as much chakra as Hashirama,  and regardless, his sage mode is definitely not as good, and wood style hax is self-explanatory... and being downgraded to just 1 EMS definitely puts Sasuke below Madara's double EMS.",

Just looking at how far Madara has gone against Hashirama with his pure combat skills and his Susanoo (and we have not seen him use other unique mangekyo abilities, unlike other Mangekyo users like Obito/Sasuke/Itachi/Shisui). Sasuke as an adult is at least that skilled, I think. And if anything, I feel like Naruto without Kurama no longer has any techniques that enable him to take on large scale attacks like wood style or perfect susanoo, which are arguably the primary techniques that put Madara and Hashirama in a league of their own. Back in the war, even Madara's basic Susanoo has proven too powerful for regular sage mode Naruto to even dent. At this point, I'm banking on Sasuke having the greatest destructive potential of the two solely because of Susanoo, *if* he can still use it with one eye, like Madara does blind.",

And in keeping the tailed beast within his body, Naruto also housed a part of the abilities of the Sage of Six Paths.\u201d\n\n1. SPSM is **never** mentioned\n\n2. You are completely glossing over \u201cin a manner of speaking\u201d\n\n3. You\u2019re missing the \u201calso\u201d in \u201cNaruto also housed a part of the abilities of the Sage of Six Paths\u201d. It never said anything about SPSM, or that losing Kurama means he loses the 8 other bijuu chakra or that he loses SPSM when he loses Kurama and/or the 8 other bijuu chakra.\n\nIt seems you deleted your comment while I was pulling the passage from the novel, probably because you realized you were wrong - but I went through this effort so im going to post it anyways on your previous reply",

Kakashi said that himself when training him to apply wind release on his rasengan. 80-10-10 is extremely lowballing. You could argue that sasuke has a greater iq and battle tactics beyond his ems, making him formidable, but Naruto has been able to outsmart and execute well orchestrated plans throughout the later end of shippuden and during the war arc. Sure he utilized kuramas chakra a lot, but most importantly, he excelled with what he had, and I\u2019m sure he can still do the same without him. So yeah don\u2019t sleep on that homie.",

But they still had separate pools, and so Kurama\u2019s vast reserves are likely gone. Naruto probably retains his Chakra, but it\u2019s not the Chakra we\u2019re used to seeing from before the Boruto era which is what I\u2019m trying to get at.",

Some people who didn't know about how naruto became the Jinchuriki thought \"oh Naruto's chakra reserves are being bolstered by the 9 tails\"  But that's not true Naruto's chakra is his chakra only and that is why he is able to become the Nine Tails Jinchuriki if he didn't have as much chakra as he did he wouldn't have been able to.  In actuality naruto's chakra played the role of suppressing the 9 tails and stopping the 9 tails's chakra from leaking out they do not naturally mix in fact in the Chunin exams an issue with naruto was that the 5 pronged seal stopped him from suppressing the 9 tails and had his chakra mixed with the 9 tails which made him worse at using his own chakra because the nine tails doesn't bolster his chakra.",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

Meaning his sensory abilities are beyond Toad Sage Mode, not to mention that the form doesn't have a time limit due to the snake constantly gathering chakra. \n\nTheir fight was not your usual fight because, Sasuke had a goal to beat Kabuto without killing him, Itachi was trying to get him in a genjutsu. Kabuto in his hand had to fight blind while trying to take control of Itachi again and immobilizing Sasuke to take control of his body later down the like. None of the characters were fighting to kill. \n\nHe also have Manda 2.0, while Toads like Gamabunta are the size of a 2-3 story house, Manda 2.0 was bigger than turtle island. He did all of that while controlling a bunch of zombies far away from the battlefield. \n\nIf he can fight basically prodigious 2 EMS users at the same thing, then he can fight one Sage Mode user.",

Kurama's Chakra \"merging\" with Naruto, is still Kurama's Chakra. Think of it like oil (Kurama) on water (Naruto). They are together, but separate. When Naruto used baryon, all of Kurama was burnt out, and the volume decreased. So no, Kurama never permanently added Chakra to Naruto's Chakra pool, he was just an addition to it, and as Naruto gained more control over his Chakra, he was able to use it more efficiently and as he befriended Kurama, he was able to pull from both sides whenever needed.\n\n(yes, I know water is heavier than oil, and tailed beast Chakra is supposed to be \"heavy\", but it's a metaphor)",

Sasuke as an adult is at least that skilled, I think. And if anything, I feel like Naruto without Kurama no longer has any techniques that enable him to take on large scale attacks like wood style or perfect susanoo, which are arguably the primary techniques that put Madara and Hashirama in a league of their own. Back in the war, even Madara's basic Susanoo has proven too powerful for regular sage mode Naruto to even dent. At this point, I'm banking on Sasuke having the greatest destructive potential of the two solely because of Susanoo, *if* he can still use it with one eye, like Madara does blind.",

Kakashi said that himself when training him to apply wind release on his rasengan. 80-10-10 is extremely lowballing. You could argue that sasuke has a greater iq and battle tactics beyond his ems, making him formidable, but Naruto has been able to outsmart and execute well orchestrated plans throughout the later end of shippuden and during the war arc. Sure he utilized kuramas chakra a lot, but most importantly, he excelled with what he had, and I\u2019m sure he can still do the same without him. So yeah don\u2019t sleep on that homie.",

In actuality naruto's chakra played the role of suppressing the 9 tails and stopping the 9 tails's chakra from leaking out they do not naturally mix in fact in the Chunin exams an issue with naruto was that the 5 pronged seal stopped him from suppressing the 9 tails and had his chakra mixed with the 9 tails which made him worse at using his own chakra because the nine tails doesn't bolster his chakra.",

The surrounding circumstance is Naruto using his chakra to make shadow clones to train, Kakashi saying to naruto just use the nine tails doesn't make sense seeing as he calls Yamato to suppress the nine tails it would just be a weird fact that doesn't help him. the translation I'm using is Hisshouburaiken translation you're using the Japflap ones I'm guessing. Kakashi does mention in the official viz media sub that he has significantly less chakra than Naruto so much less that he can't do an uneven chakra distribution or maintain shadow clones for long and it also says that if he didn't have to suppress the 9 tails he'd have 100x more. Get hulu and watch the Naruto shippuden sub. Further more Yamato backs Kakashi up by saying that since Naruto needs to use so much of his own chakra it makes his seal weaker, this is also why Kushina had issues with pregnancy",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

Kabuto in his hand had to fight blind while trying to take control of Itachi again and immobilizing Sasuke to take control of his body later down the like. None of the characters were fighting to kill. \n\nHe also have Manda 2.0, while Toads like Gamabunta are the size of a 2-3 story house, Manda 2.0 was bigger than turtle island. He did all of that while controlling a bunch of zombies far away from the battlefield. \n\nIf he can fight basically prodigious 2 EMS users at the same thing, then he can fight one Sage Mode user.",

Kurama's Chakra \"merging\" with Naruto, is still Kurama's Chakra. Think of it like oil (Kurama) on water (Naruto). They are together, but separate. When Naruto used baryon, all of Kurama was burnt out, and the volume decreased. So no, Kurama never permanently added Chakra to Naruto's Chakra pool, he was just an addition to it, and as Naruto gained more control over his Chakra, he was able to use it more efficiently and as he befriended Kurama, he was able to pull from both sides whenever needed.\n\n(yes, I know water is heavier than oil, and tailed beast Chakra is supposed to be \"heavy\", but it's a metaphor)",

Sasuke as an adult is at least that skilled, I think. And if anything, I feel like Naruto without Kurama no longer has any techniques that enable him to take on large scale attacks like wood style or perfect susanoo, which are arguably the primary techniques that put Madara and Hashirama in a league of their own. Back in the war, even Madara's basic Susanoo has proven too powerful for regular sage mode Naruto to even dent. At this point, I'm banking on Sasuke having the greatest destructive potential of the two solely because of Susanoo, *if* he can still use it with one eye, like Madara does blind.",

Kakashi said that himself when training him to apply wind release on his rasengan. 80-10-10 is extremely lowballing. You could argue that sasuke has a greater iq and battle tactics beyond his ems, making him formidable, but Naruto has been able to outsmart and execute well orchestrated plans throughout the later end of shippuden and during the war arc. Sure he utilized kuramas chakra a lot, but most importantly, he excelled with what he had, and I\u2019m sure he can still do the same without him. So yeah don\u2019t sleep on that homie.",

In actuality naruto's chakra played the role of suppressing the 9 tails and stopping the 9 tails's chakra from leaking out they do not naturally mix in fact in the Chunin exams an issue with naruto was that the 5 pronged seal stopped him from suppressing the 9 tails and had his chakra mixed with the 9 tails which made him worse at using his own chakra because the nine tails doesn't bolster his chakra.",

The surrounding circumstance is Naruto using his chakra to make shadow clones to train, Kakashi saying to naruto just use the nine tails doesn't make sense seeing as he calls Yamato to suppress the nine tails it would just be a weird fact that doesn't help him. the translation I'm using is Hisshouburaiken translation you're using the Japflap ones I'm guessing. Kakashi does mention in the official viz media sub that he has significantly less chakra than Naruto so much less that he can't do an uneven chakra distribution or maintain shadow clones for long and it also says that if he didn't have to suppress the 9 tails he'd have 100x more. Get hulu and watch the Naruto shippuden sub. Further more Yamato backs Kakashi up by saying that since Naruto needs to use so much of his own chakra it makes his seal weaker, this is also why Kushina had issues with pregnancy",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

Kabuto in his hand had to fight blind while trying to take control of Itachi again and immobilizing Sasuke to take control of his body later down the like. None of the characters were fighting to kill. \n\nHe also have Manda 2.0, while Toads like Gamabunta are the size of a 2-3 story house, Manda 2.0 was bigger than turtle island. He did all of that while controlling a bunch of zombies far away from the battlefield. \n\nIf he can fight basically prodigious 2 EMS users at the same thing, then he can fight one Sage Mode user.",

Until then we didn\u2019t know why Kurama\u2019s chakra would help Naruto like that.\n\nBut Kurama\u2019s chakra was never permanently added to Naruto\u2019s. When it leaked it would be caught by the jinchuriki seal and temporarily boost Naruto\u2019s power (this is what the mini tailed beast transformations were). And once it wore off Naruto would go back to normal, he never actually kept the chakra permanently.",

It would be a temporary boost,physically like healing wounds instantaneously,but the chakra released merges with Naruto\u2019s..He didn\u2019t train enough to make an assumption that he leveled up that way plus it would go against his characters build..leaving the permanent merger the only plausible cause. Also Before Naruto actually started training he could barely make a clone,but due to Kurama\u2019s chakra he created an army to save Iruka.Training opened the door for Kurama to leak his chakra,but no amount of training could bridge such a large gap so quickly & consistently.",

Kurama's Chakra \"merging\" with Naruto, is still Kurama's Chakra. Think of it like oil (Kurama) on water (Naruto). They are together, but separate. When Naruto used baryon, all of Kurama was burnt out, and the volume decreased. So no, Kurama never permanently added Chakra to Naruto's Chakra pool, he was just an addition to it, and as Naruto gained more control over his Chakra, he was able to use it more efficiently and as he befriended Kurama, he was able to pull from both sides whenever needed.\n\n(yes, I know water is heavier than oil, and tailed beast Chakra is supposed to be \"heavy\", but it's a metaphor)",

Kakashi said that himself when training him to apply wind release on his rasengan. 80-10-10 is extremely lowballing. You could argue that sasuke has a greater iq and battle tactics beyond his ems, making him formidable, but Naruto has been able to outsmart and execute well orchestrated plans throughout the later end of shippuden and during the war arc. Sure he utilized kuramas chakra a lot, but most importantly, he excelled with what he had, and I\u2019m sure he can still do the same without him. So yeah don\u2019t sleep on that homie.",

The surrounding circumstance is Naruto using his chakra to make shadow clones to train, Kakashi saying to naruto just use the nine tails doesn't make sense seeing as he calls Yamato to suppress the nine tails it would just be a weird fact that doesn't help him. the translation I'm using is Hisshouburaiken translation you're using the Japflap ones I'm guessing. Kakashi does mention in the official viz media sub that he has significantly less chakra than Naruto so much less that he can't do an uneven chakra distribution or maintain shadow clones for long and it also says that if he didn't have to suppress the 9 tails he'd have 100x more. Get hulu and watch the Naruto shippuden sub. Further more Yamato backs Kakashi up by saying that since Naruto needs to use so much of his own chakra it makes his seal weaker, this is also why Kushina had issues with pregnancy",

In addition official subs for Hulu say otherwise as do other translations and I'm really curious for the reason for the discrepancy as your old link was also different in how much chakra Naruto has and still with Kakashi saying you'd have more chakra if Yamato didn't suppress the nine tails yet he calls Yamato to suppress the nine tails it simply doesn't add up",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

No Chakra is being redirected its never even stated that's how it works.

You are also the dumbass that said there was no influence and that the 9 tails Chakra doesn't boost narutos Chakra.  Its also stated that when naruto is putting immense physical strain on his body it increases the chance the 9 tails can break out. Nothing to with Chakra. You are just stupid like I keep telling you",

Kabuto in his hand had to fight blind while trying to take control of Itachi again and immobilizing Sasuke to take control of his body later down the like. None of the characters were fighting to kill. \n\nHe also have Manda 2.0, while Toads like Gamabunta are the size of a 2-3 story house, Manda 2.0 was bigger than turtle island. He did all of that while controlling a bunch of zombies far away from the battlefield. \n\nIf he can fight basically prodigious 2 EMS users at the same thing, then he can fight one Sage Mode user.",

Kakashi said that himself when training him to apply wind release on his rasengan. 80-10-10 is extremely lowballing. You could argue that sasuke has a greater iq and battle tactics beyond his ems, making him formidable, but Naruto has been able to outsmart and execute well orchestrated plans throughout the later end of shippuden and during the war arc. Sure he utilized kuramas chakra a lot, but most importantly, he excelled with what he had, and I\u2019m sure he can still do the same without him. So yeah don\u2019t sleep on that homie.",

The surrounding circumstance is Naruto using his chakra to make shadow clones to train, Kakashi saying to naruto just use the nine tails doesn't make sense seeing as he calls Yamato to suppress the nine tails it would just be a weird fact that doesn't help him. the translation I'm using is Hisshouburaiken translation you're using the Japflap ones I'm guessing. Kakashi does mention in the official viz media sub that he has significantly less chakra than Naruto so much less that he can't do an uneven chakra distribution or maintain shadow clones for long and it also says that if he didn't have to suppress the 9 tails he'd have 100x more. Get hulu and watch the Naruto shippuden sub. Further more Yamato backs Kakashi up by saying that since Naruto needs to use so much of his own chakra it makes his seal weaker, this is also why Kushina had issues with pregnancy",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

When Naruto used baryon, all of Kurama was burnt out, and the volume decreased. So no, Kurama never permanently added Chakra to Naruto's Chakra pool, he was just an addition to it, and as Naruto gained more control over his Chakra, he was able to use it more efficiently and as he befriended Kurama, he was able to pull from both sides whenever needed.\n\n(yes, I know water is heavier than oil, and tailed beast Chakra is supposed to be \"heavy\", but it's a metaphor)",

The surrounding circumstance is Naruto using his chakra to make shadow clones to train, Kakashi saying to naruto just use the nine tails doesn't make sense seeing as he calls Yamato to suppress the nine tails it would just be a weird fact that doesn't help him. the translation I'm using is Hisshouburaiken translation you're using the Japflap ones I'm guessing. Kakashi does mention in the official viz media sub that he has significantly less chakra than Naruto so much less that he can't do an uneven chakra distribution or maintain shadow clones for long and it also says that if he didn't have to suppress the 9 tails he'd have 100x more. Get hulu and watch the Naruto shippuden sub. Further more Yamato backs Kakashi up by saying that since Naruto needs to use so much of his own chakra it makes his seal weaker, this is also why Kushina had issues with pregnancy",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

You are also the dumbass that said there was no influence and that the 9 tails Chakra doesn't boost narutos Chakra.  Its also stated that when naruto is putting immense physical strain on his body it increases the chance the 9 tails can break out. Nothing to with Chakra.

Until then we didn\u2019t know why Kurama\u2019s chakra would help Naruto like that.\n\nBut Kurama\u2019s chakra was never permanently added to Naruto\u2019s. When it leaked it would be caught by the jinchuriki seal and temporarily boost Naruto\u2019s power (this is what the mini tailed beast transformations were). And once it wore off Naruto would go back to normal, he never actually kept the chakra permanently.",

Also Before Naruto actually started training he could barely make a clone,but due to Kurama\u2019s chakra he created an army to save Iruka.Training opened the door for Kurama to leak his chakra,but no amount of training could bridge such a large gap so quickly & consistently.",

When Naruto used baryon, all of Kurama was burnt out, and the volume decreased. So no, Kurama never permanently added Chakra to Naruto's Chakra pool, he was just an addition to it, and as Naruto gained more control over his Chakra, he was able to use it more efficiently and as he befriended Kurama, he was able to pull from both sides whenever needed.\n\n(yes, I know water is heavier than oil, and tailed beast Chakra is supposed to be \"heavy\", but it's a metaphor)",

The surrounding circumstance is Naruto using his chakra to make shadow clones to train, Kakashi saying to naruto just use the nine tails doesn't make sense seeing as he calls Yamato to suppress the nine tails it would just be a weird fact that doesn't help him. the translation I'm using is Hisshouburaiken translation you're using the Japflap ones I'm guessing. Kakashi does mention in the official viz media sub that he has significantly less chakra than Naruto so much less that he can't do an uneven chakra distribution or maintain shadow clones for long and it also says that if he didn't have to suppress the 9 tails he'd have 100x more. Get hulu and watch the Naruto shippuden sub. Further more Yamato backs Kakashi up by saying that since Naruto needs to use so much of his own chakra it makes his seal weaker, this is also why Kushina had issues with pregnancy",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

You are also the dumbass that said there was no influence and that the 9 tails Chakra doesn't boost narutos Chakra.  Its also stated that when naruto is putting immense physical strain on his body it increases the chance the 9 tails can break out. Nothing to with Chakra.

Also Before Naruto actually started training he could barely make a clone,but due to Kurama\u2019s chakra he created an army to save Iruka.Training opened the door for Kurama to leak his chakra,but no amount of training could bridge such a large gap so quickly & consistently.",

Kurama's Chakra \"merging\" with Naruto, is still Kurama's Chakra. Think of it like oil (Kurama) on water (Naruto). They are together, but separate. When Naruto used baryon, all of Kurama was burnt out, and the volume decreased. So no, Kurama never permanently added Chakra to Naruto's Chakra pool, he was just an addition to it, and as Naruto gained more control over his Chakra, he was able to use it more efficiently and as he befriended Kurama, he was able to pull from both sides whenever needed.\n\n(yes, I know water is heavier than oil, and tailed beast Chakra is supposed to be \"heavy\", but it's a metaphor)",

The surrounding circumstance is Naruto using his chakra to make shadow clones to train, Kakashi saying to naruto just use the nine tails doesn't make sense seeing as he calls Yamato to suppress the nine tails it would just be a weird fact that doesn't help him. the translation I'm using is Hisshouburaiken translation you're using the Japflap ones I'm guessing. Kakashi does mention in the official viz media sub that he has significantly less chakra than Naruto so much less that he can't do an uneven chakra distribution or maintain shadow clones for long and it also says that if he didn't have to suppress the 9 tails he'd have 100x more. Get hulu and watch the Naruto shippuden sub. Further more Yamato backs Kakashi up by saying that since Naruto needs to use so much of his own chakra it makes his seal weaker, this is also why Kushina had issues with pregnancy",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

No Chakra is being redirected its never even stated that's how it works. Jiraiya literally states that naruto needs to use all his Chakra so he can access the 9 tails to get better at using the 9 tails Chakra. You are also the dumbass that said there was no influence and that the 9 tails Chakra doesn't boost narutos Chakra.  Its also stated that when naruto is putting immense physical strain on his body it increases the chance the 9 tails can break out. Nothing to with Chakra. You are just stupid like I keep telling you",

When Naruto used baryon, all of Kurama was burnt out, and the volume decreased. So no, Kurama never permanently added Chakra to Naruto's Chakra pool, he was just an addition to it, and as Naruto gained more control over his Chakra, he was able to use it more efficiently and as he befriended Kurama, he was able to pull from both sides whenever needed.\n\n(yes, I know water is heavier than oil, and tailed beast Chakra is supposed to be \"heavy\", but it's a metaphor)",

The surrounding circumstance is Naruto using his chakra to make shadow clones to train, Kakashi saying to naruto just use the nine tails doesn't make sense seeing as he calls Yamato to suppress the nine tails it would just be a weird fact that doesn't help him. the translation I'm using is Hisshouburaiken translation you're using the Japflap ones I'm guessing. Kakashi does mention in the official viz media sub that he has significantly less chakra than Naruto so much less that he can't do an uneven chakra distribution or maintain shadow clones for long and it also says that if he didn't have to suppress the 9 tails he'd have 100x more. Get hulu and watch the Naruto shippuden sub. Further more Yamato backs Kakashi up by saying that since Naruto needs to use so much of his own chakra it makes his seal weaker, this is also why Kushina had issues with pregnancy",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

The surrounding circumstance is Naruto using his chakra to make shadow clones to train, Kakashi saying to naruto just use the nine tails doesn't make sense seeing as he calls Yamato to suppress the nine tails it would just be a weird fact that doesn't help him. the translation I'm using is Hisshouburaiken translation you're using the Japflap ones I'm guessing. Kakashi does mention in the official viz media sub that he has significantly less chakra than Naruto so much less that he can't do an uneven chakra distribution or maintain shadow clones for long and it also says that if he didn't have to suppress the 9 tails he'd have 100x more. Get hulu and watch the Naruto shippuden sub. Further more Yamato backs Kakashi up by saying that since Naruto needs to use so much of his own chakra it makes his seal weaker, this is also why Kushina had issues with pregnancy",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

Kakashi does mention in the official viz media sub that he has significantly less chakra than Naruto so much less that he can't do an uneven chakra distribution or maintain shadow clones for long and it also says that if he didn't have to suppress the 9 tails he'd have 100x more. Get hulu and watch the Naruto shippuden sub. Further more Yamato backs Kakashi up by saying that since Naruto needs to use so much of his own chakra it makes his seal weaker, this is also why Kushina had issues with pregnancy",

When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

No Chakra is being redirected its never even stated that's how it works. Jiraiya literally states that naruto needs to use all his Chakra so he can access the 9 tails to get better at using the 9 tails Chakra. You are also the dumbass that said there was no influence and that the 9 tails Chakra doesn't boost narutos Chakra.  Its also stated that when naruto is putting immense physical strain on his body it increases the chance the 9 tails can break out. Nothing to with Chakra. You are just stupid like I keep telling you",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

You are also the dumbass that said there was no influence and that the 9 tails Chakra doesn't boost narutos Chakra.  Its also stated that when naruto is putting immense physical strain on his body it increases the chance the 9 tails can break out. Nothing to with Chakra. You are just stupid like I keep telling you",

When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

No Chakra is being redirected its never even stated that's how it works. Jiraiya literally states that naruto needs to use all his Chakra so he can access the 9 tails to get better at using the 9 tails Chakra. You are also the dumbass that said there was no influence and that the 9 tails Chakra doesn't boost narutos Chakra.  Its also stated that when naruto is putting immense physical strain on his body it increases the chance the 9 tails can break out. Nothing to with Chakra.

When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",

And for your viz media thing it's not hard to use photoshop to edit a panel on to a backdrop. When Naruto uses the 9 tails's chakra he gets either the cloak or the fox eyes two things the clones didn't have until they turned and seeing as Naruto with less than a fourth of his normal reserves could still split his chakra into uneven splits tells you there must be a must bigger gap in their chakra if an utterly exhausted Naruto could but Kakashi couldn't.",
