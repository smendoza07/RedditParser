    "body": "This is a rant more than a question. We've all seen the profiles where an 18-25 year old girl/woman thinks platonic is the norm in the sugar world, but I think it goes to a  whole new level of delusion when they put in their profile that they want online only and also have a boyfriend, but he's okay with it because they are in a rut and want to get out of it. What ever happened to the man getting a job and earning a living so that he can support his girlfriend instead of being a deadbeat and letting his girlfriend try grifting SD's. They obviously have no self respect in how they appear to women. They obviously have the right to post their profile and I have the right to skip over it, but it really makes me wonder what is going on in some people's heads these days.",

Or, put your own name in place of 'SB' in the subject line.  You are getting way to invested in your feelings here - getting pissed off about the men not providing for their gfs.  Few things here:\n\n1.  There is a fair chance they don't have a boyfriend, any more than they had a sick grandmother during covid.  People can write _anything_.  It's very possible that is just a \"sob\" story they are creating to garner sympathy, and give an excuse of why they can't meet.  \n\n2.  What makes you think it's a women?  Many of the online only/scamish profiles, are actually men in less-rich countries (like India).  For them, giving 50/100 bucks out of someone is more of a payday.\n\n3.  If we are talking about guys college age / shortly after, why do you think they should automatically be able to support another person?  I graduated 15-20 years ago, with a degree in CS.  I had a job straight out of college, making a good salary.  I worked my ass off.  But I was barely able to afford my own place, pay for a vehicle, and pay my student loans.  Now - over time (thanks to working my ass off) that changed.  But you don't become that successful in 1 or 2 years.  It takes time.\n\nThe only way to stay mentally healthy is the bowl - is not even think twice about these things.  Platonic?  Block.  Online only.  Block.  Wants her boyfriend to come along on the dinner dates?  Laugh about it, and block.  Wants some crazy amount (for you), politely say that's outside of your budget, wish them luck, and block.  And move on.\n\nYou are giving them too much space in your head for no purpose.",

Model or not she will insist she is more than worth it - with or without what many of us men hope for. And it\u2019s ok and we\u2019ll tried of here. Some men might even like only that. \n\nBut over time I have realized I can find another SB that is also a model or just extremely pretty - and have a broader relationship with all I look for. It just takes at bit more time but is not more costly. \nSo don\u2019t waste time on those who are proposing stuff you don\u2019t want. It requires a bit of discipline: Block them if necessary- if there looks is tempting you overly or whatever it is you seek. \n\nThose very rarely stray away from the platonic and they will want to be pampered just the same or more as any SB.",

He gave her another five K to shop and keep herself busy.  She sat around in London for a week.   A month later after a apologizing profusely they rescheduled under the same terms.  He again had a work emergency and she only saw him on the last morning for breakfast.   2 luxury trips to London,  about thirty g net profit and one breakfast meeting\u2026 the bowl truly is a wild place.

Many SD are married or carry on other relationships outside of an arrangement so to say \"Monogamy is gonna cost ya\" is an understatement.  Secondly, If you want an escort..... just get an escort.  \n\nI can understand women wanting to start things online only or even keep things online only.  Being clear about your boundaries is important.  \n\nI wouldn't do an in person meet until some sort of rapport has been established and I feel safe enough to do so.  So I don't advertise meet ups because honestly...... not everyone is gonna hava a chance at that.  \n\nSo to me.   While I can see what you see.  I can also see what she sees.  \nShould she maybe ..... advertise a GFE instead of a sugar relationship sure.  Cause any sugar relationship is going to have some level of affection and feelings even when it is transactional. Otherwise it's literally more of a \"just hire a good escort\" situation.  \n\nCalling people stupid or delusional is.... ahem..... kinda telling about you though.  \n\nYou can rant about your feelings on a matter without being derogatory towards others.  \n\nKudos to you for letting potential future SB's know what to expect of your temperament though.   Always good to go into these types of things with a sense of transparency. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc",

There are other roles on SW that sort of fit along those lines as well however sometimes those relationships have different meanings for different people.  \nFor example, a professional in person Domme..... you only have her attention and labor WHILE you are paying for it. \nOnline relationships CAN vary. Often do in fact. \nBut with an SB.  You are conversing with them outside of the PPM correct or if an allowance is at play. The allowance doesn't specify how many hours of their labor and attention you will receive mostly. \n\nSome SB/SD relationships ARE done with specific contracts that outline these things but that certainly isn't the norm.  That my dear is the difference.  \nMonogamy is not even within the realm of acceptable to ask from a SB unless you are ready and willing to pay for it.  Now obviously it's acceptable to have conversations about safety and exposure. To not want to have an arrangement with someone who is more lenient with safety than you would like.  \nBut to assume you get a say over what anyone else does with their body ..... without them putting that on the table.  \n\nPretty misogynistic in my opinion.   \nYour money doesn't entitle you to every aspect of a SB life.

Sugaring is different for everyone and no arrangement will ever be exactly the same as another.  \n\nI would ask though.....  How is a sugar relationship \"Like Marriage\" if no contract has been made.  \nJust.... a conversation.  \nHence why I do adore relationship contracts of all kinds. Not just in the sugaring world.  Why should a couple, Or an individual, have to abide by terms of a relationship set by .... the government; by society.  \nShouldn't we set the boundaries of our relationships for ourselves?  Shouldn't we be outlining and defining our own needs and desires and seeking what fulfills that [While being respectful of others of course]  \n\nHuman relationships are not a one size fits all situation. Hence clear communication and acknowledgments of our needs, desires and limitations.  \n\nBut sugaring.... is a mutually beneficial arrangement. \nThat fulfills needs for both individuals.  \n\nCan you get those needs met by visiting a professional SW at regular intervals..... yes.  \n\nWhether you are seeking more connection or ownership from sugaring seems unclear to me still.  \n\nConnection can be found whether someone is monogamous or not.  \nOwnership..... obviously not.  \nI wonder if your aversion to a SB having another partner has more to do with your desire to have governance over their sexlife, or concern for exposure to diseases.  \n\nThe immediate assumption that a SB would have 20 other SD's is a bit extreme in my opinion and seems...... like an attempt to skew the perspective. \nJust ONE of you is..... quite a bit of work dear.  \nHowever.  Yes if a SB has other arrangements and in those arrangements is not withholding details that impact their other partners like other sexual partners then that is perfectly acceptable. \nSame to be said for non sugar relationships in my opinion.  Both just \"Vanilla\" relationships in general and on the part of either party in a Sugar relationship.  \n\nIf a SB or SD has or wants other relationships outside of the bowl that should be at least in some part understandable at the very least.  It may not be your preference and that's fine you aren't required to be in that arrangement \ud83e\udd37 But to expect monogamy just because you are paying them.   That's not a conversation that's a demand.  One you better damn well be willing to pay for most of the time.  \n\nI would also ask you this.   Do you think every SB that has SAID they were monogamous actually has been? \nOr do you think ..... the person with the money flexed that dollar power and made it seem like they wouldn't accept any other answer? \ud83e\udd14  \nIn my experience being open and honest about this kinda stuff is the key to actual fulfillment.",

I don't fault young women for trying to make their lives better by being a SB. I actually think its smart on their part. But if they are turning around and giving their money to a guy who doesn't have the ambition to try and get ahead, then yes it irritates me to see it.

She had just created a new account on seeking, so was figuring things out.

She wanted her boyfriend to tag along, because she didn't think it would be fair for him to not get to experience it while she was going out on nice dinners.  I made a joking comment, saying... does he like to watch also?  She asked what I meant... and at that point I explained, well, I'm looking for an intimate relationship.\n\nShe was shocked.  She had no idea sex was part of it.  \n\nI respectfully explained... that's not at all (a platonic SR, not to mention the bf tagging along) what I was looking for.  Wished her the best of luck.  She asked me a whole bunch more questions about the lifestyle/my experiences.  You could tell she was legitimately trying to understand it.\n\nA couple of weeks later, she sent me a final text, thanking me for explaining it respectfully.  It was clear from talking to other guys, what she was looking for was impossible, and most were down right rude/vulgar about it.  She clearly realized this was the wrong thing for her (and her boyfriend), and was deleting her account.\n\nSocial media just gives a lot of people the wrong idea on what this shit actually is.",

At the same time someone is looking to enhance their life. \n\nThe hypocrisy of married men not wanting to date married women is bs. Everyone is taking a risk.

I actually see both sides of it and understand how online only is totally viable for some and complete bs for others. Before trashing people, maybe SEEK some understanding first. \n\nLike you said, OP, you have the option to decline those offers. But they're out there for a reason. Funny enough, I'm going through this firsthand. I actually met a guy online that I'm offering to travel pretty far to go see in person. It's not viable right now because of his schedule, but it's a hopeful situation for the future. Either way, he just sends me $ because he's showing appreciation and that he values my time. I didn't even ask for half of it. And I'm talking to him because there is some connection and appreciation for the financial help... omg, that sounds like a successful online sugar relationship, what? I know, mind-blowing. (That is meant to sound playful, not snarky, btw.) I've been a virtual gf for men who don't have the time/means to meet in person or are very far away from me. But I've been told before that I'm like an angel, I've helped people out of depression or suicidal thoughts, I've given marriage advice that's been helpful. It can serve its purpose. So, please stop being so close-minded, and at least think before posting insulting things!\n\nI've said it before, and I'll say it again, actually lemme shout it...

Cam Sex\n4.  Content selling\n5.  Non-sex texting.\n\nWhich, to the best of my knowledge, is what those websites are for.  I occasionally (as an alternate form of porn) engage in phone/cam sex.  And many of those women will try and follow up with offering more of these other items I listed above (effectively, an online relationship).  \n\nIn any case, I think you are arguing with the person here.  I agree & accept that people involved in those activities (online content/texting) are valid communities/groups of people.  That's just not what SLF is (and traditionally, is not what seeking is either).  It would be like going to ask for advice on how to best get pregnant on the childfree sub.

Making friends, or building \"platonic\" relationships isn't what the sugar lifestyle is about at all.  Maybe 2% of SD's are looking for that in which case they can get a dog.  Same goes for \"online\" relationships where the sb actually expects to be compensated for doing as little as possible and never meet the sd.  The sb's that only offer those services shouldn't be allowed on the site that I'm familiar with they should just be Cam girls.  Regarding their boyfriends I've dealt with that too and just don't care since those 2 services, which are worthless and could be argued as scams, are just an extension of the sb criminality I've experienced on a much larger scale.\n\nFinal Answer = SB's can be delusional, stupid, psychotic and wind up in prison if they aren't careful which I know to be true.  But I have yet to hear of a true story of a sd going down for felony fraud, extortion, or theft in the sugar bowl.",

It\u2019s tempting because I get a kick out of the overly good looking in this game. \n\nOne might think there would be a slight modesty coming with the platonic relationship - but there\u2019s not in my experience. Model or not she will insist she is more than worth it - with or without what many of us men hope for. And it\u2019s ok and we\u2019ll tried of here. Some men might even like only that. \n\nBut over time I have realized I can find another SB that is also a model or just extremely pretty - and have a broader relationship with all I look for. It just takes at bit more time but is not more costly. \nSo don\u2019t waste time on those who are proposing stuff you don\u2019t want. It requires a bit of discipline: Block them if necessary- if there looks is tempting you overly or whatever it is you seek. \n\nThose very rarely stray away from the platonic and they will want to be pampered just the same or more as any SB.",

Often do in fact. \nBut with an SB.  You are conversing with them outside of the PPM correct or if an allowance is at play. The allowance doesn't specify how many hours of their labor and attention you will receive mostly. \n\nSome SB/SD relationships ARE done with specific contracts that outline these things but that certainly isn't the norm.  That my dear is the difference.  \nMonogamy is not even within the realm of acceptable to ask from a SB unless you are ready and willing to pay for it.  Now obviously it's acceptable to have conversations about safety and exposure. To not want to have an arrangement with someone who is more lenient with safety than you would like.  \nBut to assume you get a say over what anyone else does with their body ..... without them putting that on the table.  \n\nPretty misogynistic in my opinion.   \nYour money doesn't entitle you to every aspect of a SB life.

Sugaring is different for everyone and no arrangement will ever be exactly the same as another.  \n\nI would ask though.....  How is a sugar relationship \"Like Marriage\" if no contract has been made.  \nJust.... a conversation.  \nHence why I do adore relationship contracts of all kinds. Not just in the sugaring world.  Why should a couple, Or an individual, have to abide by terms of a relationship set by .... the government; by society.  \nShouldn't we set the boundaries of our relationships for ourselves?  Shouldn't we be outlining and defining our own needs and desires and seeking what fulfills that [While being respectful of others of course]  \n\nHuman relationships are not a one size fits all situation. Hence clear communication and acknowledgments of our needs, desires and limitations.  \n\nBut sugaring.... is a mutually beneficial arrangement. \nThat fulfills needs for both individuals.  \n\nCan you get those needs met by visiting a professional SW at regular intervals..... yes.  \n\nWhether you are seeking more connection or ownership from sugaring seems unclear to me still.  \n\nConnection can be found whether someone is monogamous or not.  \nOwnership..... obviously not.  \nI wonder if your aversion to a SB having another partner has more to do with your desire to have governance over their sexlife, or concern for exposure to diseases.  \n\nThe immediate assumption that a SB would have 20 other SD's is a bit extreme in my opinion and seems...... like an attempt to skew the perspective. \nJust ONE of you is..... quite a bit of work dear.  \nHowever.  Yes if a SB has other arrangements and in those arrangements is not withholding details that impact their other partners like other sexual partners then that is perfectly acceptable. \nSame to be said for non sugar relationships in my opinion.  Both just \"Vanilla\" relationships in general and on the part of either party in a Sugar relationship.  \n\nIf a SB or SD has or wants other relationships outside of the bowl that should be at least in some part understandable at the very least.  It may not be your preference and that's fine you aren't required to be in that arrangement \ud83e\udd37 But to expect monogamy just because you are paying them.   That's not a conversation that's a demand.  One you better damn well be willing to pay for most of the time.  \n\nI would also ask you this.   Do you think every SB that has SAID they were monogamous actually has been? \nOr do you think ..... the person with the money flexed that dollar power and made it seem like they wouldn't accept any other answer? \ud83e\udd14  \nIn my experience being open and honest about this kinda stuff is the key to actual fulfillment.",

I don't fault young women for trying to make their lives better by being a SB. I actually think its smart on their part. But if they are turning around and giving their money to a guy who doesn't have the ambition to try and get ahead, then yes it irritates me to see it.

A lot of boys just find girlfriends to cook and do laundry for them. Girls learn or not. I dated a boy like that in my late teens, and vowed to never date a man that makes less than me again.",

She wanted her boyfriend to tag along, because she didn't think it would be fair for him to not get to experience it while she was going out on nice dinners.  I made a joking comment, saying... does he like to watch also?  She asked what I meant... and at that point I explained, well, I'm looking for an intimate relationship.\n\nShe was shocked.  She had no idea sex was part of it.  \n\nI respectfully explained... that's not at all (a platonic SR, not to mention the bf tagging along) what I was looking for.  Wished her the best of luck.  She asked me a whole bunch more questions about the lifestyle/my experiences.  You could tell she was legitimately trying to understand it.\n\nA couple of weeks later, she sent me a final text, thanking me for explaining it respectfully.  It was clear from talking to other guys, what she was looking for was impossible, and most were down right rude/vulgar about it.

Meet in person and none of this online games. I prefer to meet someone within a week of chatting to know if the relationship is going to work. \n\n Bottom line you are looking for a break, an escape from your reality. At the same time someone is looking to enhance their life. \n\nThe hypocrisy of married men not wanting to date married women is bs. Everyone is taking a risk. Whatever crazy imagination is going through your mind the same is going through the other person. \n\nGetting off my soap box",

Cam Sex\n4.  Content selling\n5.  Non-sex texting.\n\nWhich, to the best of my knowledge, is what those websites are for.  I occasionally (as an alternate form of porn) engage in phone/cam sex.  And many of those women will try and follow up with offering more of these other items I listed above (effectively, an online relationship).  \n\nIn any case, I think you are arguing with the person here.  I agree & accept that people involved in those activities (online content/texting) are valid communities/groups of people.  That's just not what SLF is (and traditionally, is not what seeking is either).  It would be like going to ask for advice on how to best get pregnant on the childfree sub.

She\u2019s a fairly well published tattoo model. I asked a few questions to make sure she wasn\u2019t being scammed then told her to go for it.  He got her a first class flight in her name and prepaid the hotel with her name on the room and off she went with half up front.  He had a work emergency and they didn\u2019t even meet.  He gave her another five K to shop and keep herself busy.  She sat around in London for a week.   A month later after a apologizing profusely they rescheduled under the same terms.  He again had a work emergency and she only saw him on the last morning for breakfast.   2 luxury trips to London,  about thirty g net profit and one breakfast meeting\u2026 the bowl truly is a wild place.

There are other roles on SW that sort of fit along those lines as well however sometimes those relationships have different meanings for different people.  \nFor example, a professional in person Domme..... you only have her attention and labor WHILE you are paying for it. \nOnline relationships CAN vary. Often do in fact. \nBut with an SB.  You are conversing with them outside of the PPM correct or if an allowance is at play. The allowance doesn't specify how many hours of their labor and attention you will receive mostly. \n\nSome SB/SD relationships ARE done with specific contracts that outline these things but that certainly isn't the norm.  That my dear is the difference.  \nMonogamy is not even within the realm of acceptable to ask from a SB unless you are ready and willing to pay for it.  Now obviously it's acceptable to have conversations about safety and exposure. To not want to have an arrangement with someone who is more lenient with safety than you would like.  \nBut to assume you get a say over what anyone else does with their body ..... without them putting that on the table.  \n\nPretty misogynistic in my opinion.   \nYour money doesn't entitle you to every aspect of a SB life.

Sugaring is different for everyone and no arrangement will ever be exactly the same as another.  \n\nI would ask though.....  How is a sugar relationship \"Like Marriage\" if no contract has been made.  \nJust.... a conversation.  \nHence why I do adore relationship contracts of all kinds. Not just in the sugaring world.  Why should a couple, Or an individual, have to abide by terms of a relationship set by .... the government; by society.  \nShouldn't we set the boundaries of our relationships for ourselves?  Shouldn't we be outlining and defining our own needs and desires and seeking what fulfills that [While being respectful of others of course]  \n\nHuman relationships are not a one size fits all situation. Hence clear communication and acknowledgments of our needs, desires and limitations.  \n\nBut sugaring.... is a mutually beneficial arrangement. \nThat fulfills needs for both individuals.  \n\nCan you get those needs met by visiting a professional SW at regular intervals..... yes.  \n\nWhether you are seeking more connection or ownership from sugaring seems unclear to me still.  \n\nConnection can be found whether someone is monogamous or not.  \nOwnership..... obviously not.  \nI wonder if your aversion to a SB having another partner has more to do with your desire to have governance over their sexlife, or concern for exposure to diseases.  \n\nThe immediate assumption that a SB would have 20 other SD's is a bit extreme in my opinion and seems...... like an attempt to skew the perspective. \nJust ONE of you is..... quite a bit of work dear.  \nHowever.  Yes if a SB has other arrangements and in those arrangements is not withholding details that impact their other partners like other sexual partners then that is perfectly acceptable. \nSame to be said for non sugar relationships in my opinion.  Both just \"Vanilla\" relationships in general and on the part of either party in a Sugar relationship.  \n\nIf a SB or SD has or wants other relationships outside of the bowl that should be at least in some part understandable at the very least.  It may not be your preference and that's fine you aren't required to be in that arrangement \ud83e\udd37 But to expect monogamy just because you are paying them.   That's not a conversation that's a demand.  One you better damn well be willing to pay for most of the time.  \n\nI would also ask you this.   Do you think every SB that has SAID they were monogamous actually has been? \nOr do you think ..... the person with the money flexed that dollar power and made it seem like they wouldn't accept any other answer? \ud83e\udd14  \nIn my experience being open and honest about this kinda stuff is the key to actual fulfillment.",

Hire an escort if that is what you are looking for.\n\nI am old school, 5 types of intimacy are to be provided mental, physical, emotional, spiritual and of course sexual. In exchange for gifts. Meet in person and none of this online games. I prefer to meet someone within a week of chatting to know if the relationship is going to work. \n\n Bottom line you are looking for a break, an escape from your reality. At the same time someone is looking to enhance their life. \n\nThe hypocrisy of married men not wanting to date married women is bs. Everyone is taking a risk. Whatever crazy imagination is going through your mind the same is going through the other person. \n\nGetting off my soap box",

Not this argument again.\n\nI understand it's hard for some people to understand... but there is a wide variety of people that sugar.  While money (or experiences) are a key part for virtually every women in the bowl - it's not \"just\" about money for many women.  \n\nAnd, this is where I guess you'll say... but if the SD wasn't providing money, the relationship would end.

Up until sometime during covid - online relationships were not even allowed on seeking.  It seems that at some point during covid, they did drop that restriction.

IF they were - they'd be in the wrong place - again, as rule number 6.  \n\nTo the best of my knowledge, online only relationships are primarily a combination of:\n\n1.  Sexting\n2.  Phone Sex\n3.  Cam Sex\n4.  Content selling\n5.  Non-sex texting.\n\nWhich, to the best of my knowledge, is what those websites are for.  I occasionally (as an alternate form of porn) engage in phone/cam sex.  And many of those women will try and follow up with offering more of these other items I listed above (effectively, an online relationship).  \n\nIn any case, I think you are arguing with the person here.  I agree & accept that people involved in those activities (online content/texting) are valid communities/groups of people.  That's just not what SLF is (and traditionally, is not what seeking is either).  It would be like going to ask for advice on how to best get pregnant on the childfree sub.  Or posting revenge stories on AITA.  It's just not the right community.",

Sugaring is different for everyone and no arrangement will ever be exactly the same as another.  \n\nI would ask though.....  How is a sugar relationship \"Like Marriage\" if no contract has been made.  \nJust.... a conversation.  \nHence why I do adore relationship contracts of all kinds. Not just in the sugaring world.  Why should a couple, Or an individual, have to abide by terms of a relationship set by .... the government; by society.  \nShouldn't we set the boundaries of our relationships for ourselves?  Shouldn't we be outlining and defining our own needs and desires and seeking what fulfills that [While being respectful of others of course]  \n\nHuman relationships are not a one size fits all situation. Hence clear communication and acknowledgments of our needs, desires and limitations.  \n\nBut sugaring.... is a mutually beneficial arrangement. \nThat fulfills needs for both individuals.  \n\nCan you get those needs met by visiting a professional SW at regular intervals..... yes.  \n\nWhether you are seeking more connection or ownership from sugaring seems unclear to me still.  \n\nConnection can be found whether someone is monogamous or not.  \nOwnership..... obviously not.  \nI wonder if your aversion to a SB having another partner has more to do with your desire to have governance over their sexlife, or concern for exposure to diseases.  \n\nThe immediate assumption that a SB would have 20 other SD's is a bit extreme in my opinion and seems...... like an attempt to skew the perspective. \nJust ONE of you is..... quite a bit of work dear.  \nHowever.  Yes if a SB has other arrangements and in those arrangements is not withholding details that impact their other partners like other sexual partners then that is perfectly acceptable. \nSame to be said for non sugar relationships in my opinion.  Both just \"Vanilla\" relationships in general and on the part of either party in a Sugar relationship.  \n\nIf a SB or SD has or wants other relationships outside of the bowl that should be at least in some part understandable at the very least.  It may not be your preference and that's fine you aren't required to be in that arrangement \ud83e\udd37 But to expect monogamy just because you are paying them.   That's not a conversation that's a demand.  One you better damn well be willing to pay for most of the time.  \n\nI would also ask you this.   Do you think every SB that has SAID they were monogamous actually has been? \nOr do you think ..... the person with the money flexed that dollar power and made it seem like they wouldn't accept any other answer? \ud83e\udd14  \nIn my experience being open and honest about this kinda stuff is the key to actual fulfillment.",

Sugaring is different for everyone and no arrangement will ever be exactly the same as another.  \n\nI would ask though.....  How is a sugar relationship \"Like Marriage\" if no contract has been made.  \nJust.... a conversation.  \nHence why I do adore relationship contracts of all kinds. Not just in the sugaring world.  Why should a couple, Or an individual, have to abide by terms of a relationship set by .... the government; by society.  \nShouldn't we set the boundaries of our relationships for ourselves?  Shouldn't we be outlining and defining our own needs and desires and seeking what fulfills that [While being respectful of others of course]  \n\nHuman relationships are not a one size fits all situation. Hence clear communication and acknowledgments of our needs, desires and limitations.  \n\nBut sugaring.... is a mutually beneficial arrangement. \nThat fulfills needs for both individuals.  \n\nCan you get those needs met by visiting a professional SW at regular intervals..... yes.  \n\nWhether you are seeking more connection or ownership from sugaring seems unclear to me still.  \n\nConnection can be found whether someone is monogamous or not.  \nOwnership..... obviously not.  \nI wonder if your aversion to a SB having another partner has more to do with your desire to have governance over their sexlife, or concern for exposure to diseases.  \n\nThe immediate assumption that a SB would have 20 other SD's is a bit extreme in my opinion and seems...... like an attempt to skew the perspective. \nJust ONE of you is..... quite a bit of work dear.  \nHowever.  Yes if a SB has other arrangements and in those arrangements is not withholding details that impact their other partners like other sexual partners then that is perfectly acceptable. \nSame to be said for non sugar relationships in my opinion.  Both just \"Vanilla\" relationships in general and on the part of either party in a Sugar relationship.  \n\nIf a SB or SD has or wants other relationships outside of the bowl that should be at least in some part understandable at the very least.  It may not be your preference and that's fine you aren't required to be in that arrangement \ud83e\udd37 But to expect monogamy just because you are paying them.   That's not a conversation that's a demand.  One you better damn well be willing to pay for most of the time.  \n\nI would also ask you this.   Do you think every SB that has SAID they were monogamous actually has been? \nOr do you think ..... the person with the money flexed that dollar power and made it seem like they wouldn't accept any other answer? \ud83e\udd14  \nIn my experience being open and honest about this kinda stuff is the key to actual fulfillment.",

Cam Sex\n4.  Content selling\n5.  Non-sex texting.\n\nWhich, to the best of my knowledge, is what those websites are for.  I occasionally (as an alternate form of porn) engage in phone/cam sex.  And many of those women will try and follow up with offering more of these other items I listed above (effectively, an online relationship).  \n\nIn any case, I think you are arguing with the person here.  I agree & accept that people involved in those activities (online content/texting) are valid communities/groups of people.  That's just not what SLF is (and traditionally, is not what seeking is either).  It would be like going to ask for advice on how to best get pregnant on the childfree sub.  Or posting revenge stories on AITA.  It's just not the right community.",
