    "body": "I booked this nice room with a balcony overlooking the Santa Monica pier and the beach.  I am chilling with my SB, and looking out at all the (socially distanced) people below.  I asked her:  \"Out of all the people you see, who is the biggest person out there that you think you could beat in a fight?\"  My SB is polite, so she picks out some random girl, even though I know she wanted to say \"all of them.\"  When it's my turn, I was looking around for a child, figuring that would get some laughs.\n#\nBut then I see this smug ass seagull.  I can't possibly describe how puffed up and self-congratulatory this bird was.  So I point him out, and my SB laughs a little more than I expected, given how serious I was.\n#\nLater, I end up needing to go to the liquor store (we ran out).  I walk out of the store, and some dude on a scooter almost runs me over.  He slams into me, spilling what I think is a giant taco salad all over my suit.  I can see the dude is OK, but before I can talk to him... That god damn jerk of a seagull  and all his friends swarm me. It was like I was wearing bird catnip.  So I ran (I ran so far away - *only 80's kids will get this joke*), but they chase me.\n#\nIn about 4 seconds, I go from my full on suit to just boxers and a mask.  I honestly don't know why it takes strippers 2-3 songs to get naked.  If this actuary gig doesn't work out for me, I am definitely going to spend my life coaching dancers on how to take their clothes off.  I will be basically stripper Buddha.  \n#\nThe seagulls are all over my clothes.  That proud little bastard is pecking at my pants, and he almost gets my wallet.  My wallet that has my room key and the allowance in it.  Mr. Gull is trying to be Mr. Steal Your Girl.  I am intellectually honest enough to admit that if any girl has the choice between me and a bird, and we are paying the same allowance, definitely go with the bird.  (Unless the bird is also bald. Then flip a coin).\n#\nAnyway, I'm not about to let that happen. I ball up my hand into a fist, and pull back.  As you all know, I don't work out my arms, but I launched a haymaker with every ounce of muscle that 35 years of vigorous and enthusiastic masturbation has built up.\n#\nI hit nothing.  By the time I stopped spinning, the birds were across the street laughing at me.\n#\nI get back to the hotel room, wondering how much of this my SB saw.  I walk in wearing just pants and a mask (my suit jacket was a mess).  When she asked what happened:\n#\nMe:  \"I fought off some muggers.\"\n[Just pointing out that this is technically 100% true]\n#\nHer:  \"Wow. Was that before you took your clothes off and danced on the sidewalk?\"\n#\nMe:  \"That was... wow, this is emasculating... that was a punch.  How could you think that was a dance?  Didn't you notice how powerful and dangerous I was being?\"\n#\nHer:  \"Did.... did you try to fight some birds... in your underwear?\"\n#\nMe:  \"I had to yeet on them haters.\"\n#\nNow I have no idea what that means, but one of my new hire employees says it and he seems to be very popular with the female associates.  Well... It worked!  My SB just laughed a lot and didn't seem to have a lot of follow up questions.  Overall, I am very pleased with my strategy. I think I will use that line whenever someone asks me questions I don't want to answer, like what my real name is, or whether I have a license to perform free mammograms in my van.",
