Even a doppelganger job wouldn't pay out atm \ud83e\udd14\n\nI think I'm gonna continue fiercing out the flow.\nI know the regret cutting it down, wouldn't be the first time.\n\nThe mentioned Geralt undercut could be an option, but I already had that last century and this time I wanted a complete head of long hair.\n\nI'm gonna try a somehow cgm as told in r/curlyhair and see how my waves turn out. Maybe I can get close to them like back in the nineties.\n\nAnd yes, a trim by a barber is quite overdue, so I will get that done.\n\nMaybe I will repost in time to show some progress.\n\nSincerely,\n*not* Julian Assange",
