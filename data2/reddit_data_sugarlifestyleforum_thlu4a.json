    "body": "By far the worst personality I\u2019ve met. She did nothing wrong, wasn\u2019t malicious or anything. But would refuse to answer any questions about herself, would be on her phone the entire time. Completely detached. \n\nWe had dinner, things were going ok, she answered in short yes or no questions, looking at her phone, paying no attention to me. So I was going to pay the bill and ditch her. She then apologized for her lack of response and then asked for money if she could come over and cuddle with me until 11 pm. I said yes thinking maybe she would start actually engaging with me. Nope. Continued to be on her phone, never made eye contact, laid there with me reaching out to cuddle but her not opening her body up for a hug.\n\nWhen I held her hand, she was like \u201cI thought you said we we\u2019re cuddling\u201d. She didn\u2019t want me to touch her belly or hug her and said that explicitly. And then she said \u201cyou didn\u2019t specify what cuddling means; you should have defined it\u201d \n\nSo I said I\u2019d like her to leave and then she said \u201cI\u2019m not leaving, you paid me until 11 pm so I\u2019m staying until then\u201d (it was 9 pm\u2014about 1 hour in). She was quite firm on this and I did not feel like making any ridiculous effort to get her out like calling the police. So I expressed all of my dissatisfaction with her and how she literally couldn\u2019t do the one thing we agreed to do. I actually blew up and made her visibly scared. So then she continued to be firm and nervously said that I could kill her if I want, but she\u2019s not leaving until time is up. Wtf? Holding me hostage in my own home?\n\nSo I offered her money to leave and she left. I thought she\u2019d feel guilty/inadequate for getting paid to literally leave and I did that on purpose so she would feel bad for what she\u2019s done . And I think it worked because she teared up that I would go as far as pay to get outta here. She definitely won in the end though, but all I could feel is relief I don\u2019t have to be in the presence of that thing for another 2 hours. \n\nWtf was that? Who is that girl? What is her deal? How could you have such a beauty-personality mismatch? I don\u2019t understand. Poor communicators need to avoid me like the plague. Be gone thots. You see these hands \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc, these hands don\u2019t touch weirdos.",

Many people would have had a reaction a lot worse than just yelling at you for wasting their time, and he also paid her to leave. She didn\u2019t lose anything in this situation. Free dinner, no conversation or service (not sexual), and then she got paid to leave HIS space because she refused after being a horrible guest, that doesn\u2019t put him in the wrong.",
