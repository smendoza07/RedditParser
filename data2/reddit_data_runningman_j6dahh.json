Like normal, SJH is the type to fulfill the mission & not goof off, she's not interested in non mission things. Screen time is earned, doing your own thing quietly while other members are trying to create funny moments is on her though. It's not the PD's fault if she herself wants to lay low, there are a few times that she's playful but it's really up to her. Most of this ep was adlib, SJH needs to be more active in creating situations for screen time, like YSC stealing food multiple times, JSM creating her own character, LKS's many ideas, etc.",

Even a lot of her screentime are members trying to frame her in a certain way or them trying to get a reaction out of her at times. And she gets some reaction shots too. Would they 'edit out' the other bits if they were funnier than this?? Actually, this clip is a creative way to give her screen time but even though I really loved how they captioned this and Jihyo looked so lovely and elegant in this scene, but if we are going to a discussion about how the production 'cut out anything she does' then this particular scene is given to her. Among a cast full of people trying to actively create content and gain screentime it will be difficult to top them for someone who is not on par with them. The previous PD focused on banter and member chemistry, however, this pd has tried to bring back sports elements so that members who are competitive can also get involved. \n\nThe edited out scenes could be funny but most likely they are not. The show has a time limit they can't show everything they captured on camera.",

Like normal, SJH is the type to fulfill the mission & not goof off, she's not interested in non mission things. Screen time is earned, doing your own thing quietly while other members are trying to create funny moments is on her though. It's not the PD's fault if she herself wants to lay low, there are a few times that she's playful but it's really up to her. Most of this ep was adlib, SJH needs to be more active in creating situations for screen time, like YSC stealing food multiple times, JSM creating her own character, LKS's many ideas, etc.",

The only thing I can say as viewer of the content we get, is that we are not seeing what she is doing, all of her moments happening off screen for us and therefore we cannot judge what their quality is, the other thing we can say, is that we are seeing more of her since Bo Pil took over, as and aside, I think Bo Pil or at least the current games, allow the older members to be focused on more.
