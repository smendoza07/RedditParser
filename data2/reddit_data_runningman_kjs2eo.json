            "body": "Because today is Christmas and for upcoming Xmas episode, lets watch back previous RM Xmas ep:\n\n1. Ep022- First Xmas, remember 1 vs X where they changed clothes? And the guest who always late at the scene.\n2. Ep074- Probably the best RM episode to this date! First superpower ep. Still remember when Haha reverse time. Legendary.\n3. Ep125- Special episode when.. how I put this, big people came out? Produce funny moments during snow sliding mission an balance mission.\n4. Ep177- Gary and Gill team try to trick the members. LKS try to fool Gill by impersonates  KJK.\n5. Ep226- After long time the 1 vs X was back. This time to legendary actress Kim Hye Ja\n6. Ep278- RM vs Xman. Bring back so many memories especially for those who follows Kvariety for a long time. My fav moment when Haha did 'Of course' to PD.\n7. Ep331- A good episode but honestly I couldn't enjoyed it that much due to KJK and SJH controversy. Sad week for runners actually.\n8. Ep382- First Xmas with JSM and YSC. Coincidently with Horror Specials. Good twist at the end.\n9. Ep431 & Ep432- Revenged of JSJ and LKS. Best moments such as SJH unfinished story, JSM danced to opposite direction, the ears game and Sooyoung betrayed KJK for second time.\n\nI just noticed last year we didn't get Xmas episode or I missed it? All in all, Xmas episodes were good episodes and I hope this week too (BTW Sooyoung is come back for Xmas ep). And Happy Christmas to everyone who celebrate it!",

This past year it feels like they've finally gotten into the best groove possible and I can't wait until next year to see how well they do because now it's just going forward on these train tracks they've set for themselves. I really enjoy how much JSM and YSC have gotten into their own roles, and while JSM kind of got into the groove quicker, YSC has been a dark horse and IMO plays a similar role to Haha in keeping the flow going with his antics. SJH has been more vocal in the recent episodes, and in the past year or so JSJ has also gotten more comfortable in his role.  I like that he's no longer just the \"race starter\" and has way more moments.",
