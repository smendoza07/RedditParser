    "body": "I ended my arrangement after 3 years.  It hurt. I wont go into the reasons. But I made her a promise to help her until she graduated. I was her first and only sd.  We met when she was 18.  I care for her to much for her to deal with sa and the scams on there. So I'm going to fulfill my promise to her even though I'm not seeing her anymore. I've been sending her an allowance for the last 2 months. Not out of an obligation but because I truly cared for her and she me.  I wish her only the best.\n\nEdit: many have asked via pm the reasons. Let's suffice it to say another member posted something similar with having to choose between her two long term daddies.  I had to do the same with my two long term spoiled gf's.",
