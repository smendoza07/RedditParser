It is only YJS and sometimes JSJ starts the conversation, force them to be a couple, but most part of the show JSM and YSC plays the game as a member of RM. Sometimes JSM starts roleplaying but YSC doesn't seem to play the role even though he is good in skit and his skit of \"BF/GF\" with Jang Do-young was hit on Big Comedy League.\n\nIf you watch the episodes when LKS and JSM won the best couple of award, you'll realize the difference. It was natural between them, not forced like this.\n\nOff screen they are really friends and who knows what will happen in the future, but for now I don't think they will win the best couple award, unless something changes.",

He doesn't like being put down by the guest or brushed aside. I mean, nobody does; but he especially can't play along with that type of joke. So I think for him to play along with this loveline would mean he has to be the butler role again and he doesn't want that. Can't blame him. He spent his first four years on the show playing the butler to KJK! It could also be that it is difficult for him to joke about this because he has real feelings for her, something he doesn't want to play around with because it is just too personal. Sort of like a \"this isn't a joke to me\" feel. Or like you said, he might have someone in his life and is just being respectful. If that was the case though, I think he should have told the cast and crew and not even have the hints of lovelines. They're cringe anyways. \ud83d\ude01",

                                                    "body": "Not sure I would put it that way. Just because he isn't willing to go there doesn't mean those who are willing don't know their worth. KwangSoo is an example of someone who would do just about anything if the role requires him even if that role is a variety persona. I think I respect that more, to tell you the truth. Not being open to certain harmless jokes and characters is definitely not something I would consider a strong point. My comment wasn't praise, quite the contrary. I think he isn't as flexible as some of the other cast members and that is one reason it took him so long to integrate into this cast. \n\nA huge part of acting (which lets face it this is) is being open to trying new things and going for it. Think of all the great actors and actresses: they're fearless performers because they don't say no when a role demands something they're uncomfortable with. In fact, most look at it as a great challenge. This is also why I believe actors are better variety stars and guests than idols and comedians. They're more open to play up their roles and can more easily detach from themselves. (Of course not all actors. Even on the cast, SJH who is an actor is an example of someone who's not good at variety, and this isn't a diss. Even her fans acknowledge this. I'm trying to say I'm not overgeneralizing.) \n\nHaving said all of this, I'm not blaming him, not at all. He has every right to choose he isn't comfortable with something and not want to do it. I'm just saying that I don't think him not doing something means others that do those things have no self-respect. I hope that is clear. \n\nAbout him not pursuing someone like an Apink member, it makes total sense. You have to realize this is an Asian country and their jobs are very public. In SK society and in the entertainment industry, a comedian is the lowest \"class\" of entertainer in the sense that it isn't exactly a respectable job that is highly regarded. I think I've seen people saying it is usually actors on the top (the only group that get seating near stages and private dressing rooms at award shows), then singers, then idols and lastly comedians. He is already at a disadvantage, especially being the man. Think of it as a male office worker being interested in a female doctor. It shouldn't matter, people are not their jobs and there is nothing wrong with being a comedian or office worker - it is just that Asian countries especially put a huge emphasis on people's jobs and social standing. This is why we grow up being forced to become either a doctor, an engineering or a lawyer. (I'm from another Asian country, not SK) \n\nVisually, I don't think women care as much about looks as men do and I also genuinely think YSC is good looking enough. So if I were NE I wouldn't care. But it's not that simple. Idol fans worship their idols, and think nobody is good enough for them. So if a guy that is average looking at best by SK's made-up beauty standards started dating their idol, all hell will break loose. So he might have been worried about that too. He isn't as famous as these idols to have seen the flood of attention, so he might have been scared. I also don't know why people keep saying he must have someone else. Y'all do know that people can not like someone without having to be in love with someone else, right?",

He spent his first four years on the show playing the butler to KJK!

Sort of like a \"this isn't a joke to me\" feel. Or like you said, he might have someone in his life and is just being respectful.

KwangSoo is an example of someone who would do just about anything if the role requires him even if that role is a variety persona. I think I respect that more, to tell you the truth. Not being open to certain harmless jokes and characters is definitely not something I would consider a strong point. My comment wasn't praise, quite the contrary. I think he isn't as flexible as some of the other cast members and that is one reason it took him so long to integrate into this cast. \n\nA huge part of acting (which lets face it this is) is being open to trying new things and going for it. Think of all the great actors and actresses: they're fearless performers because they don't say no when a role demands something they're uncomfortable with. In fact, most look at it as a great challenge. This is also why I believe actors are better variety stars and guests than idols and comedians. They're more open to play up their roles and can more easily detach from themselves. (Of course not all actors. Even on the cast, SJH who is an actor is an example of someone who's not good at variety, and this isn't a diss. Even her fans acknowledge this. I'm trying to say I'm not overgeneralizing.) \n\nHaving said all of this, I'm not blaming him, not at all. He has every right to choose he isn't comfortable with something and not want to do it. I'm just saying that I don't think him not doing something means others that do those things have no self-respect. I hope that is clear. \n\nAbout him not pursuing someone like an Apink member, it makes total sense. You have to realize this is an Asian country and their jobs are very public. In SK society and in the entertainment industry, a comedian is the lowest \"class\" of entertainer in the sense that it isn't exactly a respectable job that is highly regarded. I think I've seen people saying it is usually actors on the top (the only group that get seating near stages and private dressing rooms at award shows), then singers, then idols and lastly comedians. He is already at a disadvantage, especially being the man. Think of it as a male office worker being interested in a female doctor. It shouldn't matter, people are not their jobs and there is nothing wrong with being a comedian or office worker - it is just that Asian countries especially put a huge emphasis on people's jobs and social standing. This is why we grow up being forced to become either a doctor, an engineering or a lawyer. (I'm from another Asian country, not SK) \n\nVisually, I don't think women care as much about looks as men do and I also genuinely think YSC is good looking enough. So if I were NE I wouldn't care. But it's not that simple. Idol fans worship their idols, and think nobody is good enough for them. So if a guy that is average looking at best by SK's made-up beauty standards started dating their idol, all hell will break loose. So he might have been worried about that too. He isn't as famous as these idols to have seen the flood of attention, so he might have been scared. I also don't know why people keep saying he must have someone else. Y'all do know that people can not like someone without having to be in love with someone else, right?",

So if a guy that is average looking at best by SK's made-up beauty standards started dating their idol, all hell will break loose. So he might have been worried about that too. He isn't as famous as these idols to have seen the flood of attention, so he might have been scared. I also don't know why people keep saying he must have someone else.

He doesn't like being put down by the guest or brushed aside. I mean, nobody does; but he especially can't play along with that type of joke. So I think for him to play along with this loveline would mean he has to be the butler role again and he doesn't want that. Can't blame him. He spent his first four years on the show playing the butler to KJK! It could also be that it is difficult for him to joke about this because he has real feelings for her, something he doesn't want to play around with because it is just too personal. Sort of like a \"this isn't a joke to me\" feel. Or like you said, he might have someone in his life and is just being respectful. If that was the case though, I think he should have told the cast and crew and not even have the hints of lovelines. They're cringe anyways. \ud83d\ude01",
