She just went in on the offensive with the Twin Lion Fists, as far as I remember.\n\nIt seems like you might feel the same, but the primary reason I'm disappointed is that the Hyuga clan is so powerful, and I have a hard time believing that all those inherited jutsus and all that training had such limited effect on her ability to fight. We all know she has a very powerful Byakugan. We all know she could hold her own against Neji, and I have a hard time believing that Neji would have gone down against Pain as easily as she did. She was clearly giving it her all, so I don't think it was a confidence issue, but she only lasted a few minutes. It could have been an amazing fight, even if she still lost by miles. It just makes no sense! \n\nI guess this is years ago at this point. My hope is that more is done with Himawari in Boruto, though it does seem like she's being set up to be a more skilled kunoichi than her mom. If Himawari or Sarada end up being disappointments after the timeskip, I'll wash my hands off that series and pretend I never watched it.",

She just went in on the offensive with the Twin Lion Fists, as far as I remember.\n\nIt seems like you might feel the same, but the primary reason I'm disappointed is that the Hyuga clan is so powerful, and I have a hard time believing that all those inherited jutsus and all that training had such limited effect on her ability to fight. We all know she has a very powerful Byakugan. We all know she could hold her own against Neji, and I have a hard time believing that Neji would have gone down against Pain as easily as she did. She was clearly giving it her all, so I don't think it was a confidence issue, but she only lasted a few minutes. It could have been an amazing fight, even if she still lost by miles. It just makes no sense! \n\nI guess this is years ago at this point. My hope is that more is done with Himawari in Boruto, though it does seem like she's being set up to be a more skilled kunoichi than her mom. If Himawari or Sarada end up being disappointments after the timeskip, I'll wash my hands off that series and pretend I never watched it.",

She just went in on the offensive with the Twin Lion Fists, as far as I remember.\n\nIt seems like you might feel the same, but the primary reason I'm disappointed is that the Hyuga clan is so powerful, and I have a hard time believing that all those inherited jutsus and all that training had such limited effect on her ability to fight. We all know she has a very powerful Byakugan. We all know she could hold her own against Neji, and I have a hard time believing that Neji would have gone down against Pain as easily as she did. She was clearly giving it her all, so I don't think it was a confidence issue, but she only lasted a few minutes. It could have been an amazing fight, even if she still lost by miles. It just makes no sense! \n\nI guess this is years ago at this point. My hope is that more is done with Himawari in Boruto, though it does seem like she's being set up to be a more skilled kunoichi than her mom. If Himawari or Sarada end up being disappointments after the timeskip, I'll wash my hands off that series and pretend I never watched it.",
