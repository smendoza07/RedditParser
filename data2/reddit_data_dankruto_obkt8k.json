Any character can say \u201che\u2019s unbeatable!\u201d about anybody else, but that means nothing unless they demonstrate it. Fighting and having to be bailed out by Kankuro against Part 1 enemies isn\u2019t exactly a stellar performance. \n\nKiba is a very one-dimensional fighter, and he has to close to hand-to-hand range to do anything. All the other elements of his fighting style (clones, marking) are meant to supplement this, but they aren\u2019t a strategy in and of themselves, like Naruto would use his. Tenten has a variety of weapons for different ranges, proficiency with seals, hand-to-hand and ranged combat options, explosives, traps, and the Bashosen. From a tactical standpoint, she simply has far more options than Kiba, as well as a trump card in the Bashosen that he can\u2019t match. \n\nSaying that Ino is near the weakest of the 12 fails to take into account her utility outside of simple 1v1 tournament-style fights. Her Mind Transfer Jutsu is incredibly useful in infiltration and espionage scenarios, and her other mind techniques shine when against multiple opponents, or in a prolonged fight. With support from her teammates, she becomes very dangerous, very quickly. \n\nKiba is a straight-up brawler who is massively outclassed by all of Team 7, Lee and Neji, and probably Chouji as well in his own specialty. Of the 12, his only niche is tracking, which is why he\u2019s on Team 8 with Hinata and Shino.",

Fighting and having to be bailed out by Kankuro against Part 1 enemies isn\u2019t exactly a stellar performance. \n\nKiba is a very one-dimensional fighter, and he has to close to hand-to-hand range to do anything. All the other elements of his fighting style (clones, marking) are meant to supplement this, but they aren\u2019t a strategy in and of themselves, like Naruto would use his. Tenten has a variety of weapons for different ranges, proficiency with seals, hand-to-hand and ranged combat options, explosives, traps, and the Bashosen. From a tactical standpoint, she simply has far more options than Kiba, as well as a trump card in the Bashosen that he can\u2019t match. \n\nSaying that Ino is near the weakest of the 12 fails to take into account her utility outside of simple 1v1 tournament-style fights. Her Mind Transfer Jutsu is incredibly useful in infiltration and espionage scenarios, and her other mind techniques shine when against multiple opponents, or in a prolonged fight. With support from her teammates, she becomes very dangerous, very quickly. \n\nKiba is a straight-up brawler who is massively outclassed by all of Team 7, Lee and Neji, and probably Chouji as well in his own specialty. Of the 12, his only niche is tracking, which is why he\u2019s on Team 8 with Hinata and Shino.",

Fighting and having to be bailed out by Kankuro against Part 1 enemies isn\u2019t exactly a stellar performance. \n\nKiba is a very one-dimensional fighter, and he has to close to hand-to-hand range to do anything. All the other elements of his fighting style (clones, marking) are meant to supplement this, but they aren\u2019t a strategy in and of themselves, like Naruto would use his. Tenten has a variety of weapons for different ranges, proficiency with seals, hand-to-hand and ranged combat options, explosives, traps, and the Bashosen. From a tactical standpoint, she simply has far more options than Kiba, as well as a trump card in the Bashosen that he can\u2019t match. \n\nSaying that Ino is near the weakest of the 12 fails to take into account her utility outside of simple 1v1 tournament-style fights. Her Mind Transfer Jutsu is incredibly useful in infiltration and espionage scenarios, and her other mind techniques shine when against multiple opponents, or in a prolonged fight. With support from her teammates, she becomes very dangerous, very quickly. \n\nKiba is a straight-up brawler who is massively outclassed by all of Team 7, Lee and Neji, and probably Chouji as well in his own specialty. Of the 12, his only niche is tracking, which is why he\u2019s on Team 8 with Hinata and Shino.",

Fighting and having to be bailed out by Kankuro against Part 1 enemies isn\u2019t exactly a stellar performance. \n\nKiba is a very one-dimensional fighter, and he has to close to hand-to-hand range to do anything. All the other elements of his fighting style (clones, marking) are meant to supplement this, but they aren\u2019t a strategy in and of themselves, like Naruto would use his. Tenten has a variety of weapons for different ranges, proficiency with seals, hand-to-hand and ranged combat options, explosives, traps, and the Bashosen. From a tactical standpoint, she simply has far more options than Kiba, as well as a trump card in the Bashosen that he can\u2019t match. \n\nSaying that Ino is near the weakest of the 12 fails to take into account her utility outside of simple 1v1 tournament-style fights. Her Mind Transfer Jutsu is incredibly useful in infiltration and espionage scenarios, and her other mind techniques shine when against multiple opponents, or in a prolonged fight. With support from her teammates, she becomes very dangerous, very quickly. \n\nKiba is a straight-up brawler who is massively outclassed by all of Team 7, Lee and Neji, and probably Chouji as well in his own specialty. Of the 12, his only niche is tracking, which is why he\u2019s on Team 8 with Hinata and Shino.",
