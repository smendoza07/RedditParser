Didn't expect such a positive and reassuring reaction from so many people for something that really bothered me for some time. I will try to change the outlook and be more confident in the way I think about myself. That is not to say that I won't try new things (will cut them a bit shorter for sure), change the maintenance and look for working out and general posture excercises. \n\nOnce again, thank you **SO MUCH**\n\nHi!\n\nI have been rocking hair about this long for 3-4 years. They don't really grow longer than shoulders plus I cut the ends maybe every 6-12 months. I wash and comb them regularly, more often than necessary even. Hair stay in a manbun most of the time even during the sleep, but I don't really like how it looks, especially from the sides. My fucked up neck posture doesn't help, too. Hair don't seem to have any volume at all in a manbun, and ponytail doesn't work, too.\n\nI love wearing the hair free but it is not very comfortable or handy, so it happens really rarely, mostly during concerts, on weekends or vacations. Last two pics are me on vacay for reference.\n\nWould love to change it a bit and be more confident in my haircut and general look, but really not sure if I would look good with a short cut, I have been growing it since 7 years ago, I think, and looked quite different back then. Ideally I would love a low-maintenance not flashy but stylish cut with medium-length hair, however, I am eager to hear your opinion and am interested in any suggestions, from dreadlocks to buzzcut.\n\naddinfo:I'm tall, lanky built, mostly wear casual office clothing, live in colder climate (will start wearing a hat in a month), can't grow a beard or a moustache.\n\nThanks in advance for your input.",

If you don't like the messiness from your buns, have you considered brushing your hair up into a bun instead of using your fingers? I have layered hair that gets weird on the sides when I pull it back, so I use a brush to get it all sleek and a toothbrush with a veeeery small amount of oil on it, if I need to. I also sleep with a little oil on right after showering to get shinier hair. That might relieve the problem! You can still rake it with your fingers to keep it looking messy ish, you should just brush it first. \n\nIf its because it makes your hair look thinner, I'd suggest gentler/softer hair ties. Those squiggly ones, I'm thinking they're called bobbles, scrunchies, lighter duty hair ties like yours. Tie your buns looser in general as well. If you want a bigger bun, tugging at the sides of it to fan it out is often a good solution, or not having such a long tail. I think it would look more balanced that way. \n\nIf you still want a different hairstyle, I still suggest something longer. You have a model face- look at their hair cuts for inspiration! Longer, messy hair seems to be a constant, but you can still have it shorter than yours. Think Chalamet. Also you don't look super fine haired to me- def not thick, but its got a shape and body. You might pull of a cut similar to his for straight hair. \n\nBut tbh, you look great status quo!",

However, the main problem is that if I don't if I don't tie it quite strongly, it just tends to fall out quite fast. I think it happens because, like you said, they are not on the thicker side and compress easily under the pressure of the band. I'm just not sure it's possible to change that.\n\nHow much longer do you think? Not sure if they can go lower than shoulders. I kinda want to try the Chalamet one :D",

Trying some texture products or a grippier tie might so you some favors- look online for hair that won't keep a style, lots of information on the subject. \n\nWhen I say \"longer\" I just mean that most models have longer hair than average, but you can definitely go shorter. Chamalet is usually a good choice for anyone with textured hair, but since yours is straight and thick, you could go with something on that vein. Hopefully that's helpful!",

Reus 2014 world cup)](https://www.google.com/search?q=reus+2014+world+cup&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS761US761&oq=reus&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i20i263i433i457j0i433j0i20i263i433j0i433l3.938j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)\n\nBest advice is to be confident overall and take that confidence from your other aspects. You're good looking enough, your posture isn't as bad as you think, etc., the most important part is just to be comfortable and the easiest way to be comfortable is to show off your humor, listening skills, etc.",

Ive actually been trimming it up and my barber just took a lot off because the top of my head isnt growing as fast the sides so its leading to an awkward bit of flow. Was that a good idea? My hair is now pretty short on the sides and back but i can still put my hair in a little top bun. The plan is for the bun to move further back as everything grows back out. Did you avoid any and all haircuts and just deal with the awkward phase?",

I condition only the bottom and don\u2019t let it get on my scalp. would also recommend having it dry after a shower with a towel wrap, where you flip your hair forward then wrap it in the towel and get that fancy flip back so you can wear it for a little bit. This will help get more lift at the root. You can also try some products, like mousse, and fluff a little bit into the root working from the back to front. \nYou have wonderful hair! And a nice face!  \nI do think you\u2019d look great with shorter hair with longer bangs and a messy top.",

I don't wear my hair in a manbun, or at least I didn't before I cut it short in July, but I know from having to look smart on occasion that I could feel the strain.\n\nHonestly though, I think you're golden at the moment, what you have it very thick and it doesn't lay flat on your head like mine does. Also, that 7th picture is serious fire. Go for that style and you'll be able to rock it for a few years at least. \n\nWe both have high hairlines, so short styles will make them look higher (trust me, I made that mistake when I cut it as I just said, growing back now haha).\n\nTLDR; you're doing great, your hair looks fantastic at the moment personally, much better than mine did. Keep it like that and check back in a few years and see where your hairline is at.",

The posture is definitely noticeable and it\u2019s the one deciding factor when it comes to how you look from the side, if you do regular neck and posture stretching and exercise you can easily work up to an 8/10 without changing anything else. I know it\u2019s hard, I also have terrible posture but eventually it gets to a point when your posture is bad even when you try to stand as straight as possible because your back and neck muscles just aren\u2019t used to it. Stretching the ligaments of your neck also helps, don\u2019t want to shill but AthleanX has a good video on how to slowly fix this issue over time. Honestly, if you manage to fix this, you\u2019ll easily be a chad among men, and you get to keep your hairstyle because it\u2019s only going to complement your straight back and neck",

If you don't like the messiness from your buns, have you considered brushing your hair up into a bun instead of using your fingers? I have layered hair that gets weird on the sides when I pull it back, so I use a brush to get it all sleek and a toothbrush with a veeeery small amount of oil on it, if I need to. I also sleep with a little oil on right after showering to get shinier hair. That might relieve the problem! You can still rake it with your fingers to keep it looking messy ish, you should just brush it first. \n\nIf its because it makes your hair look thinner, I'd suggest gentler/softer hair ties. Those squiggly ones, I'm thinking they're called bobbles, scrunchies, lighter duty hair ties like yours. Tie your buns looser in general as well. If you want a bigger bun, tugging at the sides of it to fan it out is often a good solution, or not having such a long tail. I think it would look more balanced that way. \n\nIf you still want a different hairstyle, I still suggest something longer. You have a model face- look at their hair cuts for inspiration! Longer, messy hair seems to be a constant, but you can still have it shorter than yours. Think Chalamet. Also you don't look super fine haired to me- def not thick, but its got a shape and body. You might pull of a cut similar to his for straight hair. \n\nBut tbh, you look great status quo!",

[(E.g. Reus 2014 world cup)](https://www.google.com/search?q=reus+2014+world+cup&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS761US761&oq=reus&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i20i263i433i457j0i433j0i20i263i433j0i433l3.938j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)\n\nBest advice is to be confident overall and take that confidence from your other aspects. You're good looking enough, your posture isn't as bad as you think, etc., the most important part is just to be comfortable and the easiest way to be comfortable is to show off your humor, listening skills, etc.",

Also, that 7th picture is serious fire. Go for that style and you'll be able to rock it for a few years at least. \n\nWe both have high hairlines, so short styles will make them look higher (trust me, I made that mistake when I cut it as I just said, growing back now haha).\n\nTLDR; you're doing great, your hair looks fantastic at the moment personally, much better than mine did.

I don't wear my hair in a manbun, or at least I didn't before I cut it short in July, but I know from having to look smart on occasion that I could feel the strain.\n\nHonestly though, I think you're golden at the moment, what you have it very thick and it doesn't lay flat on your head like mine does. Also, that 7th picture is serious fire. Go for that style and you'll be able to rock it for a few years at least. \n\nWe both have high hairlines, so short styles will make them look higher (trust me, I made that mistake when I cut it as I just said, growing back now haha).\n\nTLDR; you're doing great, your hair looks fantastic at the moment personally, much better than mine did. Keep it like that and check back in a few years and see where your hairline is at.",

When you're walking or standing just try and keep your hips, shoulders, and ears linear with one another. Eventually it will just become natural and will feel off if they're not aligned.",

However, the main problem is that if I don't if I don't tie it quite strongly, it just tends to fall out quite fast. I think it happens because, like you said, they are not on the thicker side and compress easily under the pressure of the band. I'm just not sure it's possible to change that.\n\nHow much longer do you think? Not sure if they can go lower than shoulders. I kinda want to try the Chalamet one :D",
