I wouldn't be surprised if he gets called or visited during filming, with the cast literally making jokes about needing him for the ratings. (Remember all the jokes when Gary took a break and everyone thought he might leave--a few years before he actually did. And then they eventually made jokes about KJK and SJH after the near-firing scandal, too.)",
