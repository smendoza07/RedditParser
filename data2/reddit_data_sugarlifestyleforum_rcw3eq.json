    "body": "Telegram is the best messaging app for sugar dating, it\u2019s like whatsapp but safer and better. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. You don\u2019t need to share your phone number, you can message a POT with their username\n\n2. Great for sharing pictures & videos in high quality \n\n3. You can delete/edit any message, picture, video anytime from the chat for both. You can share a picture and then delete it after they see it. \n\n4. Wipeout full chat history with one tap, not just from your phone but your POTs device as well. \n\n5. Secret chat mode is like snap chat, auto deletes messages & media after they see it and notifies you if they screenshot it. \n\n6. Pin code lock: you can lock Telegram with a pin or Face ID. Pin can be different your phones main pin to keep it safe from the prying eyes. \n\n7. You can have multiple Telegram accounts on a same device. You can keep it separate for personal use and sugar dating. \n\n8. Audio & video calls without ever sharing your number. \n\nI see a lot of SBs using Kik which is sub-par in my experience. Telegram should be the de facto app for communication among our community.",
