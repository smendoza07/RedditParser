Plus she had those adamantine sealing chains. \n\nIf just a teeny little ghost blip of Kushina's chakra could restrain half the nine tails inside Naruto when he was trying to tame it and losing himself, she could have easily subdued or restrained 3 tails before too much damage occurred. \n\nBesides which, Kurama loathed humans and *wanted* to kill people. Isobu had a mild and soft spoken temperament. Yagura even befriended it. So even if Isobu broke out of the seal there's a good chance it wouldn't have chosen to go on a murderous rampage out of spite for humans.",

Plus she had those adamantine sealing chains. \n\nIf just a teeny little ghost blip of Kushina's chakra could restrain half the nine tails inside Naruto when he was trying to tame it and losing himself, she could have easily subdued or restrained 3 tails before too much damage occurred. \n\nBesides which, Kurama loathed humans and *wanted* to kill people. Isobu had a mild and soft spoken temperament. Yagura even befriended it. So even if Isobu broke out of the seal there's a good chance it wouldn't have chosen to go on a murderous rampage out of spite for humans.",

I can\u2019t say too much about Kushina cause there\u2019s not much evidence on how she was treated in terms of being a host for Kurama since not a lot of people knew. And although Isobu may not go into a rampage, just him being unsealed and confused in the middle of a densely populated village would cause a lot of damage, especially since people would most likely attack him on the spot out of fear",
