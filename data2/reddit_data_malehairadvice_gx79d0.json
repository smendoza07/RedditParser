Washing more frequently will actually make you oilier at the roots, I would just make sure to apply more condition at the ends and work up the strand rather than from the top down, and apply your cream to the mid strand and ends as well too, (avoid the root)!\n\nEdit:  this is easiest to acheive by applying with your head upside down btw, you might already know that, but just in case you didnt, if you flip your hair forward after the shower all your hair will hang down and you can just scrunch the curl cream into the ends and avoid your roots.\n\nA light trim on your top layers will also increase the bounce and take the weight off those curls, they'll curl even more.  You have seriously beautiful hair!  I would definitely keep frowning it out if I were you!",

            "body": "I definitely think that you can rock the longer hair, but you'll need some improvements. I'm a dude with long hair and this is what I've learned:\n\n1. You'll absolutely get more bang for your buck with your hair care if you invest in quality shampoos and conditioners. If the labeling tailors it for men, there's a decent chance you should skip on it. Tresemme products, such as the black bottles or the white and green ones that are free of silicones, are the better choices for someone looking to get something cheap. Again, stay away from shit like \"2-in-1s\".\n\n2. Do some research on how frequently (as well as HOW) you should wash and condition your hair. Create 2 - 3 days on your calendar each week that you dedicate to your hair. I'd get a hold of a routine like this before jumping into something like CGM (curly girl method), which is what r/curlyhair is going to showcase to you. CGM is fantastic, but it's something to implement later if your new to having hair like this at all. \n\n3. Don't touch a straightener, curler, or any other heat tool other than a blow dryer, and learn how to use even that correctly. Heat tools will harm your hair in the long run.\n\n4. You should stick to combing your hair with a wide tooth comb to maintain your curls and waves, but sometimes, a good detangling or paddle brush is good to have. At this length, it won't be too bad, but later on, the tangling and matted hair can be annoying to deal with if you don't comb or brush often enough. There are a ton of theories about how and how often to brush or comb your hair, so experiment and see what works for you.\n\n5. Check out some volumizing products, such as mousse or certain gels, to give your hair more oomph. You don't necessarily want the hair on top to be flat against your head, this is considered a bad look. The best way to combat this is a regular washing schedule, the products mentioned above, as well as certain styling techniques that you can google pretty easily.\n\nEdit: just a hint, but I would stay away from having long facial hair while growing out your head hair. Both at the same time is liable to give one the appearance of a gerbil, and an air of homelessness. Keep the facial hair super clean for now, grow it out later once the hair on your head is long enough to offset it.\n\n\nI hope all of that helps. You'll find a lot of great info in r/curlyhair as well as great inspiration at r/fierceflow",

I like phytokeratine extreme. \n\nConditioning is the most important. My recommendations aren\u2019t that useful here because I use a platinum blonde conditioner but I\u2019m sure you can find something. Get moisture pumped into your hair.\n\nDo a hair mask weekly. There are lots of good ones but only one S tier that will strengthen your hair more than anything else: olaplex no. 3. \n\nWhen you\u2019re done masking shampooing and conditioning, lightly towel dry your hair and then apply a small amount of hair oil. I like verb\u2019s ghost oil. You could use other stuff again that\u2019s a platinum blonde thing, but it is really nice and lightweight.\n\nThen blowdry your hair. You could use this time to apply something like a curly hair botanical oil or a blowdry spray instead, or also use a sea salt spray or something. I find I get enough heat protection from hair oil but I have incredibly fine, dead straight hair. You may want to try out something else.\n\n\nAll products here are just stuff I like and and found to work well in years of searching, not necessarily recommendations\n\nTl;dr more than anything you need to better maintain your hair and keep it clean.

The biggest struggle, for me personally, was getting past that \"awkward\" stage when you'll really want to just give in and cut it. I've got curly hair too and I noticed it got a lot more manageable once it got some length to it. \n\nMake sure you're not washing it daily like you might be used to doing with short hair. Personally, I've found washing it 2-3 times a week keeps it from getting too greasy or drying it out. Also, if it feels extremely greasy the day after washing/conditioning try using conditioner just on the base and not actually scrubbing it in at the root. IMO it definitely feels less oily when I do it that way vs conditioning the entire scalp. I've also had a couple of girls recommend dry shampoo. Personally I can't stand the way it feels but they do say it can help cut down on oil between washes.",

With your texture you should be able to wash and go but you\u2019ll need a good clarifying shampoo !!!\n\n Try Paul Michelle #3. Scrub not just your scalp but down your hair strands as well. You should do this until your hair squeaks when run it your fingers down the hair shaft. This will make such a big difference because your hair will breath and be more lively. It\u2019s a great secret to great hair. \n\nI actually didn\u2019t know I had texture in my hair until I was introduced to clarifying shampoo and then bam! Waves!! \n\nBuild up is not only from products but it\u2019s also environmental. Like if you don\u2019t have soft water in your shower. Hard water has chlorine and copper and all kinds of stuff. A clear film will come up if you boil tap water. This really distorts the hair over time. Think of clarifying as a deep cleaning! With your hair you should\nDo it every 3-6 weeks! Your hair will be shinier and bouncier and the color will be better as well. What your hair needs is a deep cleaning!!! I think you can totally rock longer hair! Also you\u2019re not alone. Most people don\u2019t use clarifying shampoo and never figure out why they don\u2019t get the full potential out of their hair! Good luck!!!!!!",

If you could section your hair or at least scrub it down the shaft between your hands in sections you\u2019ll be a lot more efficient. You will also need a good conditioner for you hair! Any professional one shall do. Depending on the width of your individuals hair strands you will have to decide how heavy of a conditioner your hair likes. Your curls will need to be weighed down just the right amount. Play with professional conditioners! It won\u2019t be as tricky as it sounds! Only brush your curly hair when it\u2019s wet out or the shower. Comb, Scrunch with towel and leave it to dry. You may want a curl cream or leave in conditioner at some point. But if you have a decent hair cut and hair care you should be able to wash and go! \ud83d\ude03",

The thing is, if you never had long hair before it will take you (and others) some time to get used to seeing yourself like this, it happens when you try a different look. It looks great though, just needs a little neatening up/slight grooming. \n\nExperiment with different hairstyles too; pony tail, one-sided (cover one ear and leave the other side behind your ear), viking braids, etc. i'm currently doing the same. I've always had the same hairstyle 3/4 of my life and lately i've tried different stuff, currently trying shoulder-length hair and i'm half-way there. How i want it to look really motivates me. \n\nIt takes quite some maintenance but it's worth it in the end, you'll learn what works and what doesn't as you go along.",

Washing more frequently will actually make you oilier at the roots, I would just make sure to apply more condition at the ends and work up the strand rather than from the top down, and apply your cream to the mid strand and ends as well too, (avoid the root)!\n\nEdit:  this is easiest to acheive by applying with your head upside down btw, you might already know that, but just in case you didnt, if you flip your hair forward after the shower all your hair will hang down and you can just scrunch the curl cream into the ends and avoid your roots.\n\nA light trim on your top layers will also increase the bounce and take the weight off those curls, they'll curl even more.  You have seriously beautiful hair!  I would definitely keep frowning it out if I were you!",

Any professional one shall do. Depending on the width of your individuals hair strands you will have to decide how heavy of a conditioner your hair likes. Your curls will need to be weighed down just the right amount. Play with professional conditioners! It won\u2019t be as tricky as it sounds! Only brush your curly hair when it\u2019s wet out or the shower. Comb, Scrunch with towel and leave it to dry. You may want a curl cream or leave in conditioner at some point. But if you have a decent hair cut and hair care you should be able to wash and go! \ud83d\ude03",

If you could section your hair or at least scrub it down the shaft between your hands in sections you\u2019ll be a lot more efficient. You will also need a good conditioner for you hair! Any professional one shall do. Depending on the width of your individuals hair strands you will have to decide how heavy of a conditioner your hair likes. Your curls will need to be weighed down just the right amount. Play with professional conditioners! It won\u2019t be as tricky as it sounds! Only brush your curly hair when it\u2019s wet out or the shower. Comb, Scrunch with towel and leave it to dry. You may want a curl cream or leave in conditioner at some point. But if you have a decent hair cut and hair care you should be able to wash and go! \ud83d\ude03",
