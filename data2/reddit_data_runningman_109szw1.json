Also promoting on RM reaches international viewership and thus would be more effective opposed to promoting on a more domestically popular show. Who's more interested in a Chinese movie: a 100% Korean audience? Or an audience that's one-third Korean, one-third assorted Asian, and one-third Non-Asian that is interested in/obsessed with Asian culture? I wouldn't be surprised if Donnie Yen's camp reached out first",

Unlike other people who talks about how they're satisfied with just the main cast, I believe that guests must always be sought after, they bring new dynamic for the cast to play with. It also helps that guests will bring new eyes to the show, people that might not watch the show otherwise if not for their favorites guesting.",
