He made the Academy, ANBU, Chunin exam and more. Other villages copied his system.\n\nMadara has no political intelligence and would have been Uchiha elders' tool, making sure all future Hokage would have Uchiha while every other clan is marginalised.

Madara tried to rally a coup, but the Uchiha banished Madara. Uchiha still in peace.\n\nWhen Tobirama became Hokage, he kept a close eye on the Uchihas by making them cops. Some became suspicious, but not all. Uchihas still in peace. \n\nYears later, Obito happened. Uchiha was still in peace, but the police force wanted a coup because they felt betrayed. Remember, the Uchiha\u2019s was completely innocent, yet they got blamed for something they didn\u2019t do. \n\n\nTL:DR\nTobirama was just racist as fuck. And was wrong. \nThe Uchihas would\u2019ve been still alive if it wasn\u2019t for Madara.\nThe Uchiha\u2019s was just regular civilians with extremely, unholy bad luck. \nThe Curse of hated didn\u2019t make the Uchiha\u2019s evil. The curse only \u201camplifies\u201d their emotions, turning them into sociopaths or aloof or whatever when ever they see their love one get murked.",

If an Uchiha witness a murder of their love ones, that\u2019s when their emotions overcome them and then they succumb to the curse. Other than that, the Uchihas are just normal people. \n\nSo Tobirama was wrong. \n\nBrief history backing up my fact:\nWhen Madara and Hashirama put their squabble aside and created Konoha, the Uchiha\u2019s was in peace. \n\nMadara became salty when the village choose Hashirama as the first Hokage. Madara tried to rally a coup, but the Uchiha banished Madara. Uchiha still in peace.\n\nWhen Tobirama became Hokage, he kept a close eye on the Uchihas by making them cops. Some became suspicious, but not all. Uchihas still in peace. \n\nYears later, Obito happened. Uchiha was still in peace, but the police force wanted a coup because they felt betrayed. Remember, the Uchiha\u2019s was completely innocent, yet they got blamed for something they didn\u2019t do. \n\n\nTL:DR\nTobirama was just racist as fuck. And was wrong. \nThe Uchihas would\u2019ve been still alive if it wasn\u2019t for Madara.\nThe Uchiha\u2019s was just regular civilians with extremely, unholy bad luck. \nThe Curse of hated didn\u2019t make the Uchiha\u2019s evil. The curse only \u201camplifies\u201d their emotions, turning them into sociopaths or aloof or whatever when ever they see their love one get murked.",

Itachi and Shisui and Kagami were doing do well unlike their elders.\n\nTobirama was right to be suspicious of them as a whole. He did the right thing. And the Uchiha proved him right by being dumb every single time. Fugaku had an issue with their clan? He should have spoken to Hiruzen about it instead of plotting.\n\nPeople should take off their Uchiha bias lenses and see Uchiha were more nothing more than stupid entitled dumbasses.

Madara tried to rally a coup, but the Uchiha banished Madara. Uchiha still in peace.\n\nWhen Tobirama became Hokage, he kept a close eye on the Uchihas by making them cops. Some became suspicious, but not all. Uchihas still in peace. \n\nYears later, Obito happened. Uchiha was still in peace, but the police force wanted a coup because they felt betrayed. Remember, the Uchiha\u2019s was completely innocent, yet they got blamed for something they didn\u2019t do. \n\n\nTL:DR\nTobirama was just racist as fuck. And was wrong. \nThe Uchihas would\u2019ve been still alive if it wasn\u2019t for Madara.\nThe Uchiha\u2019s was just regular civilians with extremely, unholy bad luck. \nThe Curse of hated didn\u2019t make the Uchiha\u2019s evil. The curse only \u201camplifies\u201d their emotions, turning them into sociopaths or aloof or whatever when ever they see their love one get murked.",

Madara tried to rally a coup, but the Uchiha banished Madara. Uchiha still in peace.\n\nWhen Tobirama became Hokage, he kept a close eye on the Uchihas by making them cops. Some became suspicious, but not all. Uchihas still in peace. \n\nYears later, Obito happened. Uchiha was still in peace, but the police force wanted a coup because they felt betrayed. Remember, the Uchiha\u2019s was completely innocent, yet they got blamed for something they didn\u2019t do. \n\n\nTL:DR\nTobirama was just racist as fuck. And was wrong. \nThe Uchihas would\u2019ve been still alive if it wasn\u2019t for Madara.\nThe Uchiha\u2019s was just regular civilians with extremely, unholy bad luck. \nThe Curse of hated didn\u2019t make the Uchiha\u2019s evil. The curse only \u201camplifies\u201d their emotions, turning them into sociopaths or aloof or whatever when ever they see their love one get murked.",

If Uchiha leader were smart, they would have done their best to make themselves loved through efficient law enforcement. Itachi and Shisui and Kagami were doing do well unlike their elders.\n\nTobirama was right to be suspicious of them as a whole. He did the right thing. And the Uchiha proved him right by being dumb every single time. Fugaku had an issue with their clan? He should have spoken to Hiruzen about it instead of plotting.\n\nPeople should take off their Uchiha bias lenses and see Uchiha were more nothing more than stupid entitled dumbasses.
