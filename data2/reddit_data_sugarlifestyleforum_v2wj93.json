    "body": "Was texting with my SB just now and she has a friend coming in from out of town.  She wanted to take her to a nice place for dinner but was stressed about the money. So I sent her some money so they could have a good time and she wouldn\u2019t have any worries. \n\nHer reply back to me was amazing.  She said \u201cthank you again for everything. You have changed my life in the best way!!\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, I melted.",
